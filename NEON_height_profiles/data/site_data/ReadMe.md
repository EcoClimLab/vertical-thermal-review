Files in this folder were sent to KAT by NEON staff in 2016 in response to a request on the vegetation type at each site. 

[This file](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/blob/master/NEON_height_profiles/data/site_data/tosDistributedPlotSamplingNlcdClass.csv) lists, by domain and site code, the vegetation classes, their area, and sampling protocol applied. Codes for sampling protocol are given in [this file](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/blob/master/NEON_height_profiles/data/site_data/moduleCodes.xlsx.
