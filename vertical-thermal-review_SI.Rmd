METHODS ON TEALEAVES GO HERE.

Energy balance for a normal overstory sun leaf and understory shade leaf were parameterized with biophysical variables from Harvard NEON data documented here: (https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/blob/master/NEON_height_profiles/HARV_neon_stats.csv). Leaf trait measurements for leaf width, ie. measured as leaf characteristic dimmension, was measured on ~Quercus rubra~ sun and shade leaf, stomatal conductance measurements were referred from Tleaves typical sun and shade measurements [@muir_tealeaves_2019] and as well @cavender-baresChangesDroughtResponse2000. 

For drought scenario, biophysical variables were parameterized similar to normal scenario using Harvard NEON data. Overstory drought PAR values reflect maximum observed Harvard NEON PAR and understory drought reflect 50% increased PAR of understory normal value. Leaf trait measurements for leaf width is the same as normal scenario, stomatal conductance is kept constant at a minimum value of 0.01 umol/m^2/s/Pa for both positions. In each visual, all variables are constant (Biophysical Constants table) except for the independent variable that represents minimum - maximum range.

![**Figure `r SIfig_NEON_all`. Vertical gradients in micrometeorological conditions for all forested sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)**. Shown are  height profiles in July mean Â± 1 standard deviation for maximum photosyntehtically active ratiation (PAR), maximum wind speed, minimum humidity, maximum $T_{air}$, and maximum biological temperature, $T_{bio}$. Sites are grouped into the following categories: (A) (sub)subtropical and warm temperate broadleaf: ..., (B) temperate open/ savanna forests: ..., (C) temperate mesic broadleaf forests: ..., (D) temperate conifer forests: ..., (E) northern and boreal forests: ...
