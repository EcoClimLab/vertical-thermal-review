  abstract = {Fire is an increasingly important agent of forest degradation in the Amazon, but little attention has been given to the susceptibility of seasonally flooded forests to fire. Satellite images suggest that forests flooded seasonally by nutrient-poor black waters are more susceptible to fire and may suffer greater fire damage than nearby upland forests. Reasons for this difference may include the presence of a root mat, more fine fuel as litter and a drier understory in the flooded forest. We investigated this difference in the field, hypothesizing that differences in the aboveground structure of the pre-burn forest can contribute to the difference in impacts of, and susceptibility to, fires. We employed a portable profiling LiDAR (PPL), first to compare damage between adjacent black water seasonally flooded and upland forests that were burned by the same fire event, and to then assess prefire canopy structure attributes known to affect fire susceptibility. For both assessments, we used PPL-derived metrics of leaf area and vertical and horizontal variation in the structure of vegetation in the canopy. Four years after the fire, the LiDAR metrics showed greater combined effects of high damage and slow recovery in the seasonally flooded forest; reduction of total Leaf Area Index (LAI) after burning was only 10\% for upland forest but was 71\% in the flood forest. Compared to unburned upland, the canopy of unburned flood forest had structural differences that increase susceptibility to fire, including drier microclimate. It had more gaps, a more open understory and a lower upper canopy. Small patches lacking canopy closure (LAI b 1.0) were far more abundant in the unburned flood forest. We conclude that black water seasonally flooded forest suffers greater fire damage than upland forest and canopy structure contributes to its greater susceptibility to the occurrence of fires. This must be considered in assessments of future Amazon fire risks and impacts, including flood forest acting as a potential conduit for spreading fire to upland forest.},

  abstract = {In tropical forests light and water availability are the most important factors for seedling growth and survival but an increasing frequency of drought may affect tree regeneration. One central question is whether drought and shade have interactive effects on seedling growth and survival. Here, we present results of a greenhouse experiment, in which seedlings of 10 Ghanaian tree species were exposed to combinations of strong seasonal drought (continuous watering versus withholding water for nine weeks) and shade (5\% irradiance versus 20\% irradiance). We evaluated the effects of drought and shade on seedling survival and growth and plasticity of 11 underlying traits related to biomass allocation, morphology and physiology. Seedling survival under dry conditions was higher in shade than in high light, thus providing support for the “facilitation hypothesis” that shade enhances plant performance through improved microclimatic conditions, and rejecting the trade-off hypothesis that drought should have stronger impact in shade because of reduced root investment. Shaded plants had low biomass fraction in roots, in line with the trade-off hypothesis, but they compensated for this with a higher specific root length (i.e., root length per unit root mass), resulting in a similar root length per plant mass and, hence, similar water uptake capacity as high-light plants. The majority (60\%) of traits studied responded independently to drought and shade, indicating that within species shade- and drought tolerances are not in trade-off, but largely uncoupled. When individual species responses were analysed, then for most of the traits only one to three species showed significant interactive effects between drought and shade. The uncoupled response of most species to drought and shade should provide ample opportunity for niche differentiation and species coexistence under a range of water and light conditions. Overall our greenhouse results suggest that, in the absence of root competition shaded tropical forest tree seedlings may be able to survive prolonged drought.},

  abstract = {In a deciduous forest, differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and adult trees could result in juvenile trees avoiding canopy shade for part of the growing season. By expanding leaves earlier or initiating senescence later than canopy trees, juvenile trees would have some period in high light and therefore greater potential carbon gain. We observed leaf phenology of 376 individuals of 13 canopy tree species weekly over 3 years in a deciduous forest in east central Illinois, USA. Our objectives were: (1) to quantify for each species the extent of differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and conspecific adult trees; and (2) to determine the extent of phenological differences between juvenile Aesculus glabra Willd. and Acer saccharum Marsh. trees in understory and gap microhabitats. All species displayed phenological differences between life stages. For 10 species, bud break was significantly earlier, by an average of 8 days, for subcanopy individuals than for canopy individuals. In 11 species, completion of leaf expansion was earlier, by an average of 6 days, for subcanopy individuals than for canopy individuals. In contrast, there were no significant differences between life stages for start of senescence in 10 species and completion of leaf drop in nine species. For eight species, leaf longevity was significantly greater for subcanopy individuals than for canopy individuals by an average of 7 days (range = 4–10 days). Leaf phenology of subcanopy individuals of both Aesculus glabra and Acer saccharum responded to gap conditions. Leaf longevity was 11 days less in the understory than in gaps for Aesculus glabra, but 14 days more in the understory than in gaps for Acer saccharum. Therefore, leaf phenology differed broadly both between life stages and within the juvenile life stage in this community. A vertical gradient in temperature sums is the proposed mechanism explaining the patterns. Temperature sums accumulated more rapidly in the sheltered understory than in an open elevated area, similar to the canopy. Early leaf expansion by juvenile trees may result in a period of disproportionately higher carbon gain, similar to gains made during summer months from use of sun flecks.},

These effects depend on local climatic characteristics and stand type. All climatic parameters should be considered, but particular attention should be paid to temperature, light and water. From a silvicultural point of view knowledge of the interactions existing between microclimatic conditions and stands, in conjunction with information now available concerning tree ecophysiology make it possible to produce viable applications which are useful for silviculture during stand formation, and for applying silvicultural treatments. Whitout a doubt, taking forest cover interactions into account (climate and ecophysiological potential of species) is the basis of sustainable management in forests. Based on the current knowledge about young stands, it is possible to use existing vegetation cover, in a more or less modified form, to improve temperature conditions especially in relation to spring frost damage, and to improve water conditions for both plant uptake and plant growth for a variable period depending on the species, but for a minimum of 4 to 5 years. For clearing and thinning, the effects of microclimatic changes created by this type of forestry management, and consequently the response of trees in terms of photosynthesis and growth, are now well defined.},

  abstract = {Because tree size and age co-vary, it is difficult to separate their effects on growth and physiological function. To infer causes for age-related height-growth decline, we compared various leaf traits between mature (ca. 100~years) and old (ca. 300~years) trees of Pinus densiflora, having similar heights (ca. 30~m) and growing in the same stand. For many leaf traits, mature and old trees showed similar height-related trends reflecting acclimation to height-related hydraulic limitation for maintaining photosynthetic and hydraulic homeostasis. Photosynthetic capacity was constant within crowns of both age-classes, though 4.9–5.4~μmol CO2 m−2~s−1 lower for old than for mature trees. Biochemical acclimation of photosynthesis, allocating more nitrogen to treetop leaves, was observed only for mature trees. Leaf turgor loss point was also constant within crowns of both age-classes with no significant effect of age on leaf hydraulic traits. In mature trees, leaf capacitance increased, while bulk tissue elastic modulus decreased with height, whereas opposite height-related trends were observed for old trees. For both age-classes, leaf mass per area (LMA), transfusion-tissue area, and xylem area all increased with height, but LMA was ca. 30~g~m−2 greater for old than for mature trees. In old trees, mesophyll area decreased with height, suggesting anatomical acclimation to height may negatively affect photosynthetic capacity. We inferred that old trees rely more on morphological than biochemical acclimation and that such post-maturational shift in resource allocation could underlie height-growth decline of P. densiflora after reproductive maturity.},

  abstract = {While foliar photosynthetic relationships with light, nitrogen, and water availability have been well described, environmental factors driving vertical gradients of foliar traits within forest canopies are still not well understood. We, therefore, examined how light availability and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) co-determine vertical gradients (between 12 and 42~m and in the understorey) of foliar photosynthetic capacity (Amax), 13C fractionation (∆), specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll (Chl), and nitrogen (N) concentrations in canopies of Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba growing in a mixed forest in Switzerland in spring and summer 2017. Both species showed lower Chl/N and lower SLA with higher light availability and VPD at the top canopy. Despite these biochemical and morphological acclimations, Amax during summer remained relatively constant and the photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE) decreased with higher light availability for both species, suggesting suboptimal N allocation within the canopy. ∆ of both species were lower at the canopy top compared to the bottom, indicating high water-use efficiency (WUE). VPD gradients strongly co-determined the vertical distribution of Chl, N, and PNUE in F. sylvatica, suggesting stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in the top canopy, whereas these traits were only related to light availability in A. alba. Lower PNUE in F. sylvatica with higher WUE clearly indicated a trade-off in water vs. N use, limiting foliar acclimation to high light and VPD at the top canopy. Species-specific trade-offs in foliar acclimation to environmental canopy gradients may thus be considered for scaling photosynthesis from leaf to canopy to landscape levels.},

  abstract = {Leaf optical parameters influence light availability at the cellular, leaf, and canopy scale of integration. While recent studies have focused on leaf optical responses to acute plant stress, the effects of changes in plant resources on leaf optics remain poorly characterized. We examined leaf optical and anatomical responses of five temperate deciduous tree species to moderate changes in nutrient and light availability. Spectral reflectance in the visible waveband generally increased at high light, but decreased with increased nutrient availability. Patterns of both spectral reflectance and absorptance were primarily determined by chlorophyll concentration although carotenoid concentration was also influential. While most anatomical features did not explain residual variation in reflectance, cuticle thickness was significantly related to reflectance at complementary angles compared to the angle of incidence. Absorptance did not change with light environment; however, absorption efficiency per unit biomass increased by approximately 40\% under low light, due to reduced leaf mass per area. We conclude that changes in resource availability differentially influence leaf optical properties and that such changes are driven primarily by changes in pigment concentrations. The magnitude of leaf optical responses to moderate changes in resource availability was comparable to those of acute stress responses and varied among species.},

  abstract = {We have characterized overstory light transmission, understory light levels, and plant communities in mixedwood boreal forests of northwestern Quebec with the objective of understanding how overstory light transmission interacts with composition and time since disturbance to influence the diversity and composition of understory vegetation, and, in turn, the further attenuation of light to the forest floor by the understory. Overstory light transmission differed among three forest types (aspen, mixed deciduous–conifer, and old cedar-dominated), with old forests having higher proportions of high light levels than aspen and mixed forests, which were characterized by intermediate light levels. The composition of the understory plant communities in old forests showed the weakest correlation to overstory light transmission, although those forests had the largest range of light transmission. The strongest correlation between characteristics of overstory light transmission and understory communities was found in aspen forests. Species diversity indices were consistently higher in aspen forests but showed weak relationships with overstory light transmission. Light attenuation by the understory vegetation and total height of the understory vegetation were strongly and positively related to overstory light transmission but not forest type. Therefore, light transmission through the overstory influenced the structure and function of understory plants more than their diversity and composition. This is likely due to the strong effect of the upper understory layers, which tend to homogenize light levels at the forest floor regardless of forest type. The understory plant community acts as a filter, thereby reducing light levels at the forest floor to uniformly low levels.},

  abstract = {The response of small understory trees to long-term drought is vital in determining the future composition, carbon stocks and dynamics of tropical forests. Long-term drought is, however, also likely to expose understory trees to increased light availability driven by drought-induced mortality. Relatively little is known about the potential for understory trees to adjust their physiology to both decreasing water and increasing light availability. We analysed data on maximum photosynthetic capacity (Jmax, Vcmax), leaf respiration (Rleaf), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf thickness and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from 66 small trees across 12 common genera at the world's longest running tropical rainfall exclusion experiment and compared responses to those from 61 surviving canopy trees. Small trees increased Jmax, Vcmax, Rleaf and LMA (71, 29, 32, 15\% respectively) in response to the drought treatment, but leaf thickness and leaf nutrient concentrations did not change. Small trees were significantly more responsive than large canopy trees to the drought treatment, suggesting greater phenotypic plasticity and resilience to prolonged drought, although differences among taxa were observed. Our results highlight that small tropical trees have greater capacity to respond to ecosystem level changes and have the potential to regenerate resilient forests following future droughts.},

  abstract = {A spatially explicit mechanistic model, MAESTRA, was used to separate key parameters affecting transpiration to provide insights into the most influential parameters for accurate predictions of within-crown and within-canopy transpiration. Once validated among Acer rubrum L. genotypes, model responses to different parameterization scenarios were scaled up to stand transpiration (expressed per unit leaf area) to assess how transpiration might be affected by the spatial distribution of foliage properties. For example, when physiological differences were accounted for, differences in leaf width among A. rubrum L. genotypes resulted in a 25\% difference in transpiration. An in silico within-canopy sensitivity analysis was conducted over the range of genotype parameter variation observed and under different climate forcing conditions. The analysis revealed that seven of 16 leaf traits had a ≥5\% impact on transpiration predictions. Under sparse foliage conditions, comparisons of the present findings with previous studies were in agreement that parameters such as the maximum Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis can explain ∼20\% of the variability in predicted transpiration. However, the spatial analysis shows how such parameters can decrease or change in importance below the uppermost canopy layer. Alternatively, model sensitivity to leaf width and minimum stomatal conductance was continuous along a vertical canopy depth profile. Foremost, transpiration sensitivity to an observed range of morphological and physiological parameters is examined and the spatial sensitivity of transpiration model predictions to vertical variations in microclimate and foliage density is identified to reduce the uncertainty of current transpiration predictions.},

  abstract = {Leaves come in a remarkable diversity of sizes and shapes. However, spatial patterns in leaf trait diversity are rarely investigated and poorly resolved. We used a hierarchical approach to evaluate vertical variability in leaf morphology (i.e., leaf trait diversity) in 16 common tree and shrub species inhabiting a New Zealand forest. Height-related heterogeneity in leaf area, specific leaf area, circularity and length to width ratio was analyzed at three scales: (1) among leaves within plants, (2) among plants within species and (3) among species within functional groups (i.e., trees vs. shrubs). Results were scale dependent. Among-leaf morphological diversity was unrelated to plant height. Among-individual morphological diversity increased with the average height of each species, indicating that taller plant species express a greater range of leaf traits than shorter species. Among-species morphological diversity was higher in shrubs than in trees. We hypothesize that scale-dependent patterns in leaf trait diversity result from scale-dependent adaptations to forest environmental conditions. As trees grow from the forest floor into the canopy, they are exposed to a range of environmental conditions, which may select for a range of leaf traits through ontogeny. Conversely, shrubs never reach the forest canopy and may instead be differentially adapted to suites of environmental conditions associated with different stages of forest recovery from tree-fall disturbances. Overall results indicate that vertical patterns in leaf trait diversity exist. However, their strength and directionality are strongly scale-dependent, suggesting that different processes govern leaf shape diversity at different levels of ecological organization.},

A 2009 Nature paper (go.nature.com/yuz2we) showed that the velocity of climate change is higher in lowland than in highland areas, suggesting that the lag behind climate warming might be greater for lowland species than that for highland species. This suspicion is confirmed in a study of forests distributed across France. A comparison of temperature trends against temperatures reconstructed from thousands of species assemblages across a 44-year period (1965–2008) indicated a temperature lag between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests that was more than three times that seen in highland forests. This finding has implications for conservation policy. Attention has focused on mountain-top extinctions as a likely consequence of climate warming, but the inertia of forest plant communities suggests that species in lowland forest ecosystems are also at risk.},

These receptors control avoidance responses to preclude exposure to limiting or excessive light and acclimation responses to cope with conditions that cannot be avoided. The low red/far-red ratios of shade light reduce phytochrome B activity, which allows PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) to directly activate the transcription of auxin-synthesis genes, leading to shade-avoidance responses. Direct PIF interaction with DELLA proteins links gibberellin and brassinosteroid signaling to shade avoidance. Shade avoidance also requires CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1), a target of cryptochromes, phytochromes, and UVR8. Multiple regulatory loops and the input of the circadian clock create a complex network able to respond even to subtle threats of competition with neighbors while still compensating for major environmental fluctuations such as the day-night cycles.},

Conversely, in the common garden, the different genotypes expressed a homogeneous sun phenotype, while phenotypic differences among populations remained apparent in shade leaves. 5. We conclude that, in agreement with our working hypothesis, canopy plasticity is both cause and consequence of the environment experienced by the plant and might lead to the differential expression of genetic polymorphisms among leaves. Furthermore, we propose that it can contribute to buffer abiotic stress and to the partition of light use within the tree crown.},

  abstract = {Both within and between species, leaf physiological parameters are strongly related to leaf dry mass per area (LMA, g/m2), which has been found to increase from forest floor to canopy top in every forest where it has been measured. Although vertical LMA gradients in forests have historically been attributed to a direct phenotypic response to light, an increasing number of recent studies have provided evidence that water limitation in the upper canopy can constrain foliar morphological adaptations to higher light levels. We measured height, light, and LMA of all species encountered along 45 vertical canopy transects across a Costa Rican tropical rain forest. LMA was correlated with light levels in the lower canopy until approximately 18 m sample height and 22\% diffuse transmittance. Height showed a remarkably linear relationship with LMA throughout the entire vertical canopy profile for all species pooled and for each functional group individually (except epiphytes), possibly through the influence of gravity on leaf water potential and turgor pressure. Models of forest function may be greatly simplified by estimating LMA-correlated leaf physiological parameters solely from foliage height profiles, which in turn can be assessed with satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing.},

The habitats investigated were a 0.5 ha clearing, a 400 m2 gap, a 200 m2 gap, and heavily shaded understorey. (2) Measurements were made during both wet and dry seasons under a variety of weather conditions. Quantum sensors were used to monitor continuously 10-min average PPFD over a 3-10 day period at each location. Daily average PPFD, total daily PPFD, and daily frequency distributions were analysed for two adjacent sensors per site on each sampling day. (3) Daily total PPFD in the understorey, 200 m2 gap, and 400 m2 gap were 1-2\%, 9\%, and 20-35\%, respectively, of PPFD in the clearing. Daily total PPFD in the 400 m2 gap during the dry season was, on average, 2.4 times greater than in the 200 m2 gap, and 20-25 times those in the understorey. In the 200 m2 gap, daily total PPFD was nine times greater than in the understorey during the dry season. (4) In the clearing, PPFD was significantly different between seasons with 24\% higher PPFD during the dry season. In the 400 m2 gap and understorey, PPFD was not significantly different between seasons. (5) The percentage of available PPFD reaching the understorey was highest on cloudy, overcast days and lowest on sunny days. No correlation was found between daily total PPFD in the 400 m2 gap centre and in the adjacent understorey measured on the same days. (6) In the clearing, a high proportion of 10-min averages were greater than 500 μ mol m-2 s-1; in the 400 m2 gap, a high proportion of 10-min averages were between 100 μ mol m-2 s-1 and 500 μ mol m-2 s-1; in the understorey over 70\% of the 10-min averages were below 10 μ mol m-2 s-1. The clearing exhibited the greatest diurnal variation in PPFD and the least day-to-day variation, whereas the understorey exhibited the least diurnal variation and the greatest day-to-day variation in PPFD.},

Although LES is well established for traits of sun leaves, it is unclear how well LES characterizes the diversity of traits for shade leaves. Here, we evaluate LES using the sun and shade leaves of 75 woody species sampled at the extremes of a within-canopy light gradient in a subtropical forest. Shading significantly decreased the mean values of LMA and the rates of photosynthesis and dark respiration, but had no discernable effect on nitrogen and phosphorus content. Sun and shade leaves manifested the same relationships among Nmass, Pmass, Amass, and Rmass (i.e., the slopes of log–log scaling relations of LES traits did not differ between sun and shade leaves). However, the difference between the scaling constants of shade and sun leaves was correlated with functional trait plasticity. Although the generality of this finding should be evaluated further using larger datasets comprising more phylogenetically diverse taxa and biomes, these findings support a unified LES across shade as well as sun leaves.},

Xylem pathways increase when trees grow tall, which results in the increase in water gravity as well as pathway resistance. Accordingly, the physiological characteristics of leaves change along with tree height. In this research, the photosynthetic characteristics and carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) in the leaves of 4 tree species, Platanus hispanica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Fraxinus chinensis and Ginkgo biloba, were measured. The results showed that the leaf photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Cond) and internal CO2 concentration (Ci) reduced along with tree height, while the leaf δ13C increased along with tree height. The One Way ANOVA and LSD tests showed that the leaf photosynthetic characteristics and δ13C varied significantly at different tree heights (P {$<$} 0.05). The decrease in leaf photosynthetic capability and the increase in δ13C along with tree height indicate that the leaves at the tree tops suffer from water stress. These results support the hydraulic limitation hypothesis.},

Vertical distributions of these traits may change over time in temperate deciduous forests as a result of acclimation to light, which may result in seasonal changes in Ac. To assess both spatial and temporal variations in key traits, we measured vertical profiles of Narea and LMA from leaf expansion through leaf senescence in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) forest. To investigate mechanisms behind coordinated changes in leaf morphology and function, we also measured vertical variation in leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13C), predawn turgor pressure, leaf water potential and osmotic potential. Finally, we assessed potential biases in Ac estimations by parameterizing models with and without vertical and seasonal Narea variations following leaf expansion. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrostatic constraints on leaf morphology drive the vertical increase in LMA with height early in the growing season; however, LMA in the upper canopy continued to increase over time during light acclimation, indicating that light is primarily driving gradients in LMA later in the growing season. Models with no seasonal variation in Narea overestimated Ac by up to 11\% early in the growing season, while models with no vertical variation in Narea overestimated Ac by up to 60\% throughout the season. According to the multilayer model, the upper 25\% of leaf area contributed to over 50\% of Ac, but when gradients of intercellular CO2, as estimated from δ13C, were accounted for, the upper 25\% of leaf area contributed to 26\% of total Ac.

  abstract = {Within-canopy gradients of leaf functional traits have been linked to both light availability and vertical gradients in leaf water potential. While observational studies can reveal patterns in leaf traits, within-canopy experimental manipulations can provide mechanistic insight to tease apart multiple interacting drivers. Our objectives were to disentangle effects of height and light environment on leaf functional traits by experimentally shading branches along vertical gradients within a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest. Shading reduced leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea), and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and increased mass-based leaf nitrogen (Nmass), highlighting the importance of light availability on leaf morphology and chemistry. Early in the growing season, midday leaf water potential (ψmid) LMA, and Narea were driven primarily by height; later in the growing season, light became the most important driver for LMA and Narea. Carbon isotope composition (δ¹³C) displayed strong, linear correlations with height throughout the growing season, but did not change with shading, implying that height is more influential than light on water use efficiency and stomatal behavior. LMA, leaf density, Nmass, C:N ratio, and δ¹³C all changed seasonally, suggesting that leaf ageing effects on leaf functional traits are equally as important as microclimatic conditions. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit or ψmid constrains the supply of CO₂ to leaves at higher heights, independent of light environment, and (2) LMA and Narea distributions become functionally optimized through morphological acclimation to light with increasing leafage despite height-related constraints.},

  abstract = {Deciduousness is an important functional attribute of tropical trees, reflecting climatic conditions. Precisely quantifying and mapping deciduousness in tropical forests will be necessary for calibrating remote sensing images which attempt to assess canopy properties such as carbon cycling, productivity, or chlorophyll content. We thus set out to assess the degree of canopy deciduousness in three moist, semi-deciduous tropical forests in central Panama. One site is a 6-ha research plot near the Atlantic coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2830 mm/yr. The second site is a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, near the center of the isthmus of Panama, where rainfall is 2570 mm/yr, and the final site is a 4-ha plot near the Pacific coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2060 mm/yr. At each site, a random sample of trees from all canopy species (those with individuals ≥ 30 cm DBH) were visited and scored for deciduousness three times during the 1997 dry season. The estimated peak fraction of deciduous individuals in the canopy at the wetter site was 4.8\%, at the intermediate site, 6.3\%, and at the drier site, 24.3\%. The estimated fraction of crown area deciduous peaked at 3.6\%, 9.7\%, and 19.1\% at the wet, medium, and dry sites respectively. The percentage of canopy species that was deciduous – 14\%, 28\%, and 41\% – was much higher than the percentage of deciduous individuals, because not all individuals of deciduous species were deciduous. During the 1999 dry season, every individual of all the deciduous species was visited at the two drier sites, and the total number of deciduous trees observed closely matched the estimated numbers based on the smaller 1997 samples.},

  abstract = {Tree crowns are spatially heterogeneous, sometimes resulting in significant variation in microclimate across the canopy, particularly with respect to temperature. Yet it is not known whether such localised temperature variation equates to intracanopy variation in leaf-level physiological thermal tolerance. Here, we studied whether microclimate variation across the canopy of a dominant desert tree equated to localised variation in leaf thermal thresholds (T50) among four canopy positions: upper south, upper north, lower south, lower north. Principal component analysis was used to generate a composite climatic stress variable (CSTRESS) from canopy temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and relative humidity. We also determined the average number of days that maximum temperatures exceeded the air temperature equating to this species’ critical threshold of 49 °C (­ AT49). To estimate how closely leaf temperatures track ambient temperature, we predicted the thermal time constant (τ) for leaves at each canopy position. We found that CSTRESS and ­AT49 were significantly greater in lower and north-facing positions in the canopy. Differences in wind speed with height resulted in significantly longer predicted τ for leaves positioned at lower, north-facing positions. Variation in these drivers was correlated with significantly higher T50 for leaves in these more environmentally stressful canopy positions. Our findings suggest that this species may optimise resources to protect against thermal damage at a whole-plant level. They also indicate that, particularly in desert environments with steep intracanopy microclimatic gradients, whole-plant carbon models could substantially under- or overestimate productivity under heat stress, depending on where in the canopy T50 is measured.},

Wind speed attenuation within the tree crown was strongly correlated to the cumulative leaf area along the wind path into the crown, as deduced from the 3D distribution of the tree foliage, obtained by the combined use of digitizing and allometric relationships. Simulations by the RATP model, i.e., a 3D numerical model of radiation transfer, leaf transpiration and photosynthesis (Sinoquet et al., 1999), were used (i) to study the spatial variations of transpiration, photosynthesis and leaf-to-atmosphere coupling within the tree crown; and (ii) to analyse coupling at tree level, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of total transpiration to climate variations. The main results of the simulations were: (i) spatial variations of stomatal conductance were mainly responsible for the important spatial variation of the leaf-to-air decoupling factor (Ω) within the tree crown; (ii) high coupling was observed at tree level, so that whole tree transpiration was primarily controlled by air VPD and secondarily by radiation; (iii) wind velocity and direction influenced only weakly the local transpiration, and had no effect on photosynthetic rates.},

Canopy buffering of temperature and vapor pressure deficit was greater at higher levels of canopy cover, and varied with water balance, implying that buffering effects are subject to changes in local hydrology. We project changes in the water balance for the mid-21st century and predict how such changes may impact the ability of western US forests to buffer climate extremes. Our results suggest that some forests will lose their capacity to buffer climate extremes as sites become increasingly water limited.

We show that forests function as a thermal insulator, cooling the understory when ambient temperatures are hot and warming the understory when ambient temperatures are cold. The understory versus open temperature offset is magnified as temperatures become more extreme and is of greater magnitude than the warming of land temperatures over the past century. Tree canopies may thus reduce the severity of warming impacts on forest biodiversity and functioning.},

  abstract = {Around the globe, climate warming is increasing the dominance of warm-adapted species—a process described as “thermophilization.” However, thermophilization often lags behind warming of the climate itself, with some recent studies showing no response at all. Using a unique database of more than 1,400 resurveyed vegetation plots in forests across Europe and North America, we document significant thermophilization of understory vegetation. However, the response to macroclimate warming was attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser. This microclimatic effect likely reflects cooler forest-floor temperatures via increased shading during the growing season in denser forests. Because standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, microclimate may commonly buffer understory plant responses to macroclimate warming., Recent global warming is acting across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems to favor species adapted to warmer conditions and/or reduce the abundance of cold-adapted organisms (i.e., “thermophilization” of communities). Lack of community responses to increased temperature, however, has also been reported for several taxa and regions, suggesting that “climatic lags” may be frequent. Here we show that microclimatic effects brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming, thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1,409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests, each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12–67 y, we document significant thermophilization of ground-layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However, thermophilization, particularly the increase of warm-adapted species, is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser, probably reflecting cooler growing-season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, local microclimatic effects may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely, increases in harvesting woody biomass—e.g., for bioenergy—may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity.},

Here, for sapling communities of two tropical dry forest types in Costa Rica, we show large differences amongst traits in the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variation to their directional changes in response to environmental changes along a successional gradient. We studied the response of functional traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum and drought tolerance using intensive sampling to analyse inter- and intra-specific responses to environmental changes and ontogeny. Although the overall functional composition of the sapling communities changed during succession more through species turnover than through intraspecific trait variation, their relative contributions differed greatly amongst traits. For instance, community mean specific leaf area changed mostly due to intraspecific variation. Traits of the leaf economics spectrum showed decoupled responses to environmental drivers and ontogeny. These findings emphasise how divergent ecological mechanisms combine to cause great differences in changes of individual functional traits over environmental gradients and ecological scales.},

  abstract = {Canopy phenology of Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana, a dominant semi-deciduous species of the northern Sahelian zone, was monitored for 39 mature individuals, each month and bi-weekly in the rainy season, over a 5.5-year period in North Senegal. To investigate the relationships between leaf phenology and environmental variables, soil water availability and several climatic variables were monitored. Over six rainy seasons, annual rainfall ranged between 146 and 367mm. The full canopy stage lasted between 5 and 8 months, broadly including the rainy season (July–September) and the “cool” dry season (November–January). A significant inter-annual variation, up to 2.0 months, affects both the timing of the peaks of leaf flush and leaf fall. The canopy was maintained during the dry season despite low upper soil water availability and tree roots had access to a deep water table (31m). These results support the current view that in the dry tropics, groundwater availability is the major environmental variable controlling leaf phenology. However, inter-annual variation in the peaks of leaf flush and leaf fall could not be explained by ground water, genetics or day length. In such water-controlled biome, we focused on a comparison between two additional drivers, upper soil water availability and climatic variables which contribute to evaporative demand. Models predicting changes in canopy fullness from environmental variables were investigated by polynomial logistic regression. We considered each tree and pooled all the years, distinguishing periods of leaf flush (April–August) and leaf fall (January–April). Then, the ability of such models to predict inter-annual variation in the timing of peaks of leaf flush and leaf fall was tested. Inter-annual variation in the timing of leaf flush peak was well predicted by models based on air relative humidity or vapour pressure deficit or global radiation (root mean square error=0.5 month and R2=0.8). Inter-annual variation of leaf fall peak was also significantly predicted by models based on atmospheric variables (temperatures or maximum value of vapour pressure deficit) however with weaker relationships (root mean square error=0.7 month and R2=0.7). By contrast, models based on upper soil water availability or rainfall did not predict either leaf flush or leaf fall inter-annual variation. It appears that inter-annual variation of canopy phenology is mainly tuned to atmospheric conditions. Such behaviour maximizes the duration of high photosynthetic activity below a threshold of evaporative demand.},

  abstract = {We used leaf gas exchange, sap flow, and eddy covariance measurements to investigate whether high temperature substantially limits CO2 uptake at the LBA-ECO (Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere) km-83 tropical forest site in Brazil. Leaf-level temperature-photosynthesis curves, and comparisons of whole-canopy net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) with air temperature, showed that CO2 uptake declined sharply during warm periods. Observations of ambient leaf microclimate showed that leaves oscillate between two states: a cool, dimly lit stage and a hot, brightly illuminated stage where leaf temperatures are often greater than 35°C. The leaf-level rates of photosynthesis decreased when shaded leaves (∼ambient air temperature and {$<$} 500 μmol m−2 s−1) were transferred into a prewarmed, brightly illuminated chamber (35° to 38°C and 1000 μmol m−2 s−1), coincident with increased leaf temperature, increased evaporative demand, and stomatal closure. The rates of whole-canopy CO2 uptake calculated at 5-min intervals increased initially at the onset of sunny periods that followed extended cloudy periods, but then decreased as the sunlight continued, leaf temperature and evaporative demand increased, and canopy conductance decreased. The forest at km-83 appears to be close to a high temperature threshold, above which CO2 uptake drops sharply. This sensitivity results in part from the covariance between leaf temperature and leaf illumination; the brightly illuminated leaves that contribute disproportionately to canopy photosynthesis are warmed to the point that leaf gas exchange is curtailed.},

We show that the mean temperature of the warmest quarter (3-month period) passed the thermal maximum for photosynthesis during the past decade. At higher temperatures, respiration rates continue to rise in contrast to sharply declining rates of photosynthesis.

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause shifts in the composition of tropical montane forests towards increased relative abundances of species whose ranges were previously centered at lower, hotter elevations. To investigate this process of “thermophilization,” we analyzed patterns of compositional change over the last decade using recensus data from a network of 16 adult and juvenile tree plots in the tropical forests of northern Andes Mountains and adjacent lowlands in northwestern Colombia. Analyses show evidence that tree species composition is strongly linked to temperature and that composition is changing directionally through time, potentially in response to climate change and increasing temperatures. Mean rates of thermophilization [thermal migration rate (TMR), °C⋅y               −1               ] across all censuses were 0.011 °C⋅y               −1               (95\% confidence interval = 0.002–0.022 °C⋅y               −1               ) for adult trees and 0.027 °C⋅y               −1               (95\% confidence interval = 0.009–0.050 °C⋅y               −1               ) for juvenile trees. The fact that thermophilization is occurring in both the adult and juvenile trees and at rates consistent with concurrent warming supports the hypothesis that the observed compositional changes are part of a long-term process, such as global warming, and are not a response to any single episodic event. The observed changes in composition were driven primarily by patterns of tree mortality, indicating that the changes in composition are mostly via range retractions, rather than range shifts or expansions. These results all indicate that tropical forests are being strongly affected by climate change and suggest that many species will be at elevated risk for extinction as warming continues.},

Conclusions 703 Acknowledgements 703 References 703 Summary When the rate of photosynthesis is greatly diminished, such as during severe drought, extreme temperature or low light, it seems advantageous for plants to close stomata and completely halt water loss. However, water loss continues through the cuticle and incompletely closed stomata, together constituting the leaf minimum conductance (gmin). In this review, we critically evaluate the sources of variation in gmin, quantitatively compare various methods for its estimation, and illustrate the role of gmin in models of leaf gas exchange. A literature compilation of gmin as measured by the weight loss of detached leaves is presented, which shows much variation in this trait, which is not clearly related to species groups, climate of origin or leaf type. Much evidence points to the idea that gmin is highly responsive to the growing conditions of the plant, including soil water availability, temperature and air humidity – as we further demonstrate with two case studies. We pay special attention to the role of the minimum conductance in the Ball–Berry model of stomatal conductance, and caution against the usual regression-based method for its estimation. The synthesis presented here provides guidelines for the use of gmin in ecosystem models, and points to clear research gaps for this drought tolerance trait.},

  abstract = {Stable carbon isotope composition varies markedly between sun and shade leaves, with sun leaves being invariably more enriched (i.e., they contain more13C). Several hypotheses have emerged to explain this pattern, but controversy remains as to which mechanism is most general. We measured vertical gradients in stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) in more than 200 trees of nine conifer species growing in mixed-species forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. For all species except western larch, δ13C decreased from top to bottom of the canopy. We found that δ13C was strongly correlated with nitrogen per unit leaf area (Narea), which is a measure of photosynthetic capacity. Usually weaker correlations were found between δ13C and leaf mass per area, nitrogen per unit leaf mass, height from the ground, or depth in the canopy, and these correlations were more variable between trees than for Narea. Gradients of δ13C (per meter canopy depth) were steeper in small trees than in tall trees, indicating that a recent explanation of δ13C gradients in terms of drought stress of upper canopy leaves is unlikely to apply in our study area. The strong relationship between Narea and δ13C here reported is consistent with the general finding that leaves or species with higher photosynthetic capacity tend to maintain lower CO2 concentrations inside leaves. We conclude that photosynthetic capacity is a strong determinant of δ13C in vertical canopy profiles, and must be accounted for when interpreting δ13C values in conifer forests.},

  abstract = {Mesophyll resistance to CO2 diffusion (rm) and the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax) affect photosynthetic rates, and can potentially also influence the percentage of respiratory and photorespiratory CO2 being refixated (Pr) by mesophyll cells. Here we investigated how various leaf anatomical traits (e.g. leaf mass per area [LMA] and leaf dry matter content [LDMC]) influenced rm in leaves of mature forest trees. We further explored how rm and Vcmax in turn affected Pr, and if these traits varied among species and leaves along a light gradient. Photosynthetic CO2 response of leaves grown in high-, medium-, and low-light environments was measured, from Pinus sylvestris [Scots pine], Picea abies [Norway spruce], Quercus robur [English oak], and Betula pendula [Silver birch] in southern Sweden. A modified version of the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model was fitted to the leaf gas exchange data to estimate Vcmax, rm and Pr. We found that of all leaf traits measured, only LMA for Q. robur was significantly higher in leaves from high-light environments. When comparing species, both rm and LMA were significantly higher in the conifers, and rm had a negative correlation with Vcmax. We found that Pr was similar between different species and functional groups, with an average of 73.2\% (and SD of ±10.4) across all species. There was a strong, positive correlation between Pr and Vcmax in broadleaves, and we hypothesise that this effect might derive from a higher CO2 drawdown near Rubisco in leaves with high Vcmax.},

This study investigated changes in leaf morphology and anatomy with tree age and height in the broadleaved evergreen species, Eucalyptus regnans. Fully expanded leaves were sampled from the upper canopy of tree ages ranging from 6 to 240 years, and tree heights ranging from about 10–80~m. There were significant changes in leaf form with increasing tree age and height. Leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area/leaf mass) decreased, leaf thickness increased, and leaves became narrower relative to their length, with increasing tree age and height. Cuticle thickness and leaf waxiness, including wax occlusion of the stomatal antechamber, increased with increasing age and height. By comparison, there were no clear trends in stomatal frequency or stomatal length with tree age, although there were curvilinear relationships between an index of total stomatal pore area per leaf lamina and both tree age and tree height. The results support the hypothesis that leaves of E. regnans become more xeromorphic with tree age and height. The results are discussed in relation to their significance for changes in water relations in the canopy with age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ecologists are increasingly using plant functional traits to predict community assembly, but few studies have linked functional traits to species' responses to fine-scale resource gradients. In this study, it was tested whether saplings of woody species partition fine-scale gradients in light availability based on their leaf mass per area (LMA) in three temperate rain forests and one Mediterranean forest in southern Chile. METHODS: LMA was measured under field conditions of all woody species contained in approx. 60 plots of 2 m2 in each site, and light availability, computed as the gap light index (GLI), was determined. For each site, species' pairwise differences in mean LMA (Δ LMA) and abundance-weighted mean GLI (Δ light response) of 2 m2 plots were calculated and it was tested whether they were positively related using Mantel tests, i.e. if species with different LMA values differed in their response to light availability. Additionally linear models were fitted to the relationship between plot-level mean LMA and GLI across plots for each site. KEY RESULTS: A positive and significant relationship was found between species' pairwise differences in mean LMA and differences in light response across species for all temperate rain forests, but not for the Mediterranean forest. The results also indicated a significant positive interspecific link between LMA and light availability for all forests. This is in contrast to what is traditionally reported and to expectations from the leaf economics spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: In environments subjected to light limitation, interspecific differences in a leaf trait (LMA) can explain the fine-scale partitioning of light availability gradients by woody plant species. This niche partitioning potentially facilitates species coexistence at the within-community level. The high frequency of evergreen shade-intolerant species in these forests may explain the positive correlation between light availability and LMA.},

  abstract = {Given anticipated climate changes, it is crucial to understand controls on leaf temperatures including variation between species in diverse ecosystems. In the first study of leaf energy balance in tropical montane forests, we observed current leaf temperature patterns on 3 tree species in the Atlantic forest, Brazil, over a 10‐day period and assessed whether and why patterns may vary among species. We found large leafto‐air temperature differences (maximum 18.3 °C) and high leaf temperatures (over 35 °C) despite much lower air temperatures (maximum 22 °C). Leaf‐to‐air temperature differences were influenced strongly by radiation, whereas leaf temperatures were also influenced by air temperature. Leaf energy balance modelling informed by our measurements showed that observed differences in leaf temperature between 2 species were due to variation in leaf width and stomatal conductance. The results suggest a trade‐off between water use and leaf thermoregulation; Miconia cabussu has more conservative water use compared with Alchornea triplinervia due to lower transpiration under high vapour pressure deficit, with the consequence of higher leaf temperatures under thermal stress conditions. We highlight the importance of leaf functional traits for leaf thermoregulation and also note that the high radiation levels that occur in montane forests may exacerbate the threat from increasing air temperatures.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering the distributions of species, which in turn causes shifts in the composition of plant communities. Specifically, rising temperatures should cause increasing relative abundances of heat-loving or heat-tolerant species (that is, ‘thermophilization’) and changes in precipitation should cause altered abundances of water-demanding species. We analysed millions of records of thousands of species and found that the plant communities in most ecoregions in North, Central and South America have experienced thermophilization over the past four decades (1970–2011). Thermophilization was fastest in ecoregions with intermediate temperatures and was positively correlated with warming rates within many biomes. Changes in the relative abundances of water-demanding species were less consistent and were not correlated with changes in precipitation, meaning that the drought sensitivity of some ecoregions may be increasing despite decreasing rainfall and increasing probabilities of drought. Climate-driven changes in plant community composition will affect the function and stability of New World ecoregions.},

  abstract = {Due to global warming, many species will face greater risks of thermal stress, which can lead to changes in performance, abundance, and/or geographic distributions. In plants, high temperatures above a species-specific critical thermal maximum will permanently damage photosystem II, leading to decreased electron transport rates, photosynthetic failure, and eventual leaf and plant death. Previous studies have shown that plant thermal tolerances vary with latitude, but little is known about how they change across smaller-scale thermal gradients (i.e., with elevation) or about how these thermal tolerances relate to species’ local performances and geographic distributions. In this study, we assess the maximum photosynthetic thermal tolerances (T50) of nearly 200 tropical tree species growing in 10 forest plots distributed across a {$>$}2,500 m elevation gradient (corresponding to a 17◦C temperature gradient) in the northern Andes Mountains of Colombia. Using these data, we test the relationships between species’ thermal tolerances and (1) plot elevations and temperatures, (2) species’ largescale geographic distributions, and (3) changes in species’ abundances through time within the plots. We found that species’ T50 do in fact decrease with plot elevation but significantly slower than the corresponding adiabatic lapse rate (−0.4 vs. −5.7◦C km−1) and that there remains a large amount of unexplained variation in the thermal tolerances of co-occurring tree species. There was only a very weak association between species’ thermal tolerances and their large-scale geographic distributions and no significant relationships between species’ thermal tolerances and their changes in relative abundance through time. A potential explanation for these results is that thermal tolerances are adaptations to extreme leaf temperatures that can be decoupled from regional air temperatures due to microclimatic variations and differences in the species’ leaf thermoregulatory properties.},

We examined the role of these parameters as protection mechanisms in an altitudinal gradient of increasing UV radiation in northern Catalonia and in sun and shade leaves. The concentration of UV-B radiation absorbing pigments was 15\% higher in sun leaves of Q. ilex at 1200 m than in those from 200 m altitude. Sun leaves of R. ferrugineum presented concentrations three times higher than those of Q. ilex. Reflectance ranged between 5\% (in the region 300–400 nm) and 12\% (in the region 280–300 nm). The variation of reflectance with altitude followed an inverse trend respect to absorbance in the 280–300 nm region, with higher values the lower the altitude, but in the 300–400 nm region, reflectance of the lower site was the lowest. In both species and altitudes sun leaves presented higher concentrations of UV-B radiation absorbing pigments and UV reflectance than shade leaves. Quercus ilex trees of the higher location presented higher NDPI (Normalized Difference Pigment Reflectance Index) values, indicating higher carotenoids/chlorophyll a ratio. Actual measurements of carotenoid/chlorophyll a ratio confirmed this pattern. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) presented higher values the higher the location indicating lower photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency. Specific leaf weight (SLW) and leaf thickness were larger in Q. ilex trees of higher location than in those of lower location. In both sites, sun leaves also presented larger SLW values than shade leaves. Adaxial leaf hair density in sun leaves was significantlly higher in the lower location. UV absorption and linked morphological traits (SLW, leaf thickness measured in Q. ilex) presented the larger differences among studied plants at different altitudes and seem to be the dominant UV protecting mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Modification of foliage exposition and morphology by seasonal average integrated quantum flux density (Qint) was investigated in the canopies of the shade-tolerant latesuccessional deciduous tree species Fagus orientalis Lipsky and Fagus sylvatica L. Because the leaves were not entirely flat anywhere in the canopy, the leaf lamina was considered to be three-dimensional and characterized by the cross-sectional angle between the leaf halves (θ). Both branch and lamina inclination angles with respect to the horizontal scaled positively with irradiance in the canopy, allowing light to penetrate to deeper canopy horizons. Lamina cross-sectional angle varied from 170° in the most shaded leaves to 90–100° in leaves in the top of the canopy. Thus, the degree of leaf rolling increased with increasing Qint, further reducing the light-interception efficiency of the upper-canopy leaves. Simulations of the dependence of foliage light-interception efficiency on θ demonstrated that decreases in θ primarily reduce the interception efficiency of direct irradiance, but that diffuse irradiance was equally efficiently intercepted over the entire range of θ values in our study. Despite strong alteration in foliage light-harvesting capacity within the canopy and greater transmittance of the upper crown compared with the lower canopy, mean incident irradiances varied more than 20-fold within the canopy, indicating inherent limitations in light partitioning within the canopy. This extensive canopy light gradient was paralleled by plastic changes in foliar structure and chemistry. Leaf dry mass per unit area varied 3–4-fold between the canopy top and bottom, providing an important means of scaling foliage nitrogen contents and photosynthetic capacity per unit area with Qint. Although leaf structure versus light relationships were qualitatively similar in all cases, there were important tree-to-tree and species-to-species variations, as well as evidence of differences in investments in structural compounds within the leaf lamina, possibly in response to contrasting leaf water availability in different trees.},

Photoreceptor regulation of shade avoidance 932 References 940 IV. Molecular mechanisms in shade avoidance signalling 934 Summary The threat to plant survival presented by light limitation has driven the evolution of highly plastic adaptive strategies to either tolerate or avoid shading by neighbouring vegetation. When subject to vegetational shading, plants are exposed to a variety of informational signals, which include altered light quality and a reduction in light quantity. The former includes a decrease in the ratio of red to far-red wavelengths (low R : FR) and is detected by the phytochrome family of plant photoreceptors. Monitoring of R : FR ratio can provide an early and unambiguous warning of the presence of competing vegetation, thereby evoking escape responses before plants are actually shaded. The molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses to alterations in light quality have now started to emerge, with major roles suggested for the PIF (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR) and DELLA families of transcriptional regulators. Such studies suggest a complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous signals, mediated by multiple photoreceptors. The phenotypic similarities between physiological responses habitually referred to as ‘the shade avoidance syndrome’ and other abiotic stress responses suggest plants may integrate common signalling mechanisms to respond to multiple perturbations in their natural environment.},

Canopy position was found to be important for needle structure, as sun needles had significantly higher values than shade needles for all anatomical traits (i.e., cross‐sectional needle area, number of tracheids in needle, needle hydraulic conductivity, and tracheid lumen area), except proportion of xylem area per cross‐sectional needle area. In sun needles, drought reduced all trait values by 10–40\%, whereas in shade needles, only tracheid maximum diameter was reduced by drought. Due to the relatively weaker response of shade needles than sun needles in drought‐stressed trees, the difference between the two needle types was reduced by 25\% in the drought‐stressed trees compared to the control trees. The observed changes in needle anatomy provide new understanding of how Norway spruce adapts to drought stress and may improve predictions of how forests will respond to global climate change.},

This edition has been revised to keep abreast of current research in all aspects of microclimatology, to provide more examples of work from North America, and to more clearly illustrate how surface energy fluxes are linked to the nature of the surface environment. The authors have added discussions dealing with the speed of sound, the use of vegetative barriers to reduce sound, and physiological control of energy and moisture exchanges. They have also expanded the discussion of microclimatic effects on animal and human behavior and dwellings, as well as updated methods of measurement and notation.

The effects of shade on leaf morphology and anatomy, including stomatal density and chloroplast structure, net photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g s), and fruit yield were studied. Shade reduced leaf thickness due to the presence of only 1–2 palisade layers and reduced the length of palisade cells and spongy parenchyma. The number of thylakoids in grana as well as in stroma increased as shade increased, while the number of plastoglobuli decreased in proportion to the reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The higher the level of shade, the lower the stomatal and trichome density, leaf mass per area (ALM), g s, and P N. Shade of 30, 60, and 90 \% reduced stomatal density by 7, 16, and 27 \%, respectively, while the corresponding reduction in P N was 21, 35, and 67 \%. In contrast, chlorophyll a+b per fresh mass, and leaf width, length, and particularly area increased under the same shade levels (by 16, 33, and 81 \% in leaf area). P N reduction was due both to a decrease in PAR and to the morphological changes in leaves. The effect of shade was more severe on fruit yield per tree (32, 67, and 84 \%) than on P N indicating an effect on bud differentiation and fruit set. The olive tree adapts well to shade compared with other fruit trees by a small reduction in stomatal and trichome density, palisade parenchyma, and a significant increase in leaf area.}

  abstract = {• Leaf respiration and its temperature response were measured in 4-m-tall, 1-yr-old Populus deltoides trees to assess the effect of within-canopy distribution of respiratory physiology on total foliar C exchange of a model ecosystem at Biosphere 2. • Over the course of five nights, air temperature was varied over a 10°C range and the steady-state rate of leaf respiration was measured. These data were then modeled to calculate the temperature response of leaf and canopy respiration. • Results indicate that there is considerable within-canopy variation in both the rate of respiration and its temperature response and that these variables are most strongly related to leaf carbohydrate and leaf N. Scaling these results to the ecosystem level demonstrates the importance of quantifying the vertical distribution of respiratory physiology, particularly at lower temperatures. • Simplifying assumptions regarding the variation in respiration and its temperature response with canopy height tend to result in an underestimation of the actual C loss if the assumptions are based on lower- or mid-canopy leaf physiology, but overestimate C loss if the model assumptions are based on upper-canopy physiology.},

  abstract = {During the exposition to moderate high-temperature stress, photosynthetic rates and fluorescence of chlorophyll a were measured with a photosynthetic measurement system (Li-Cor 6400) and leaf chamber fluorometer (Li-Cor6400 LCF), respectively, in leaves of saplings, sun-adapted species (Schima superba), shade-adapted species (Cryptocarya concinna), and in mesophytic plant (Castanopsis hystrix) (42°C). The results showed that moderate high-temperature stress led to a decrease in Fv/Fm, namely the primary photochemical quantum efficiency, indicating that moderate high-temperature stress causes a partial inhibition of PSII. It also showed that such an effect was more severe in the shade-adapted plant C. concinna than in the sun-adapted species S. superba. However, except for the sun-grown leaves of C. concinna, the moderate high-temperature stress increased the photosynthetic rate of leaves at high light intensity. Simultaneously, less photoinhibition was found to occur under high-light intensity, suggesting that the capacity of resistant-photoinhibition was stimulated by moderate high-temperature stress. The quantum yield of PSII (ϕPSII) decreased in the sun-grown leaves of S. superba and C. hystrix but did not show any significant change in leaves of the shade plant C. concinna and shade-grown leaves of sun plant S. superba or the mesophytic plant C. hystrix because they already had a very low ϕPSII under this condition. Moderate high-temperature stress led to a decrease in ϕPSII/ϕCO2 ratios, an estimate of the quantum requirement for CO2 assimilation, in the sun plant S. superba and the mesophytic plant C. hystrix because they were associated with the dissipation of a lower fraction of excitation energy. However, no significant changes were found in shade plant C. concinna and in shade-grown leaves of the other examined plants. The effect of moderate high-temperature (42°C) on photosynthesis depends on species and leaf type (sun and shade leaves) in the saplings of subtropical broad-leaved trees.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to reviewing literature may be susceptible to bias and result in incorrect decisions. This is of particular concern when reviews address policy- and practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a ‘critical friend’ role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the ‘systematic review’ label, we go on to identify methodological solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support available to avoid these issues and call on the entire community, including systematic review specialists, to work towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and better decisions.},

The juveniles of the 17 species included in the study were grown in high light, similar to the exposed crowns of the adult trees. The traits were structural, biomechanical, chemical and photosynthetic. With increasing species gap dependence, leaf mass per area (LMA) decreased only slightly in juveniles and remained constant in adults, whereas punch strength together with tissue density decreased, and photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll increased. Contrary to what has been mostly found in evergreen tropical rainforest, the trade-off between investment in longevity and in productivity was evident at an essentially constant LMA. Of the traits pertaining to the chloroplast level, photosynthetic capacity per unit chlorophyll increased with gap dependence, but the chlorophyll a/b ratio showed no relationship. Adults had a twofold higher LMA, but leaf strength was on average only about 50\% larger. Leaf tissue density, and chlorophyll and leaf N per area were also higher, whereas chlorophyll and leaf N per unit dry mass were lower. Ranking of the species, relationships between traits and with the gap dependence of the species were similar for juveniles and adults. However, the magnitudes of most ontogenetic changes were not clearly related to a species’ gap dependence. The adaptive value of the leaf traits for juveniles and adults is discussed.},

  abstract = {The vertical structure of a tropical rain forest is complex and multilayered, with strong variation of micro-environment with height up to the canopy. We investigated the relation between morphological traits of leaf surfaces and tree ecological characteristics in a Malaysian tropical rain forest. The shapes and densities of stomata and trichomes on the abaxial leaf surfaces and their relation with leaf characteristics such as leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA) were studied in 136 tree species in 35 families with different growth forms in the tropical moist forest. Leaf physiological properties were also measured in 50 canopy and emergent species. Most tree species had flat type (40.4 \%) or mound type (39.7 \%) stomata. In addition, 84 species (61.76 \%) in 22 families had trichomes, including those with glandular (17.65 \%) and non-glandular trichomes (44.11 \%). Most leaf characteristics significantly varied among the growth form types: species in canopy and emergent layers and canopy gap conditions had higher stomatal density, stomatal pore index (SPI), trichome density and LMA than species in understory and subcanopy layers, though the relation of phylogenetically independent contrasts to each characteristic was not statistically significant, except for leaf stomatal density, SPI and LMA. Intrinsic water use efficiency in canopy and emergent tree species with higher trichome densities was greater than in species with lower trichome densities. These results suggest that tree species in tropical rain forests adapt to a spatial difference in their growth forms, which are considerably affected by phylogenetic context, by having different stomatal and trichome shapes and/or densities.},

  abstract = {In addition to the limited availability of canopy resistance (rc) data for a variety of vegetation surfaces at different development stages, and at a range of soil water and climatic conditions, one challenge in practical application of the Penman–Monteith (PM) model is scaling up leaf level stomatal resistance (rL) to rc to represent an integrated resistance from plant communities to quantify field-scale evaporative losses. We present an integrated approach to scale up rL to rc. We measured rL for subsurface drip-irrigated (non-stressed) corn (Zea mays L.) plants and integrated a number of microclimatic and in-canopy radiation transfer parameters to scale up rL to rc. With the espousal of microclimatic and crop factors such as leaf area index for sunlit and shaded leaves, solar zenith angle, direct and diffuse solar radiation, we scaled up rL as a function of measured photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). We also estimated rc by solving the PM model on an hourly time-step using the Bowen ratio energy balance system-measured latent heat. There was an asymptotic relationship between the rL and PPFD. The rL showed a sudden (almost instantaneous) response to changing PPFD. The minimum value of rL was measured in the morning as 74sm−1 (PPFD=400μmolm−2s−1), whereas the maximum resistance occurred in the late afternoon as 910sm−1 (PPFD=111μmolm−2s−1). Beyond a certain amount of PPFD (approximately 800μmolm−2s−1), rL became less responsive to PPFD. Despite the changes in microclimatic conditions, the resistance remained relatively constant during the midday hours. A relatively constant pattern of rL was most likely during the period when the supply of water from plant roots kept pace with the transpiration rate. At lower PPFD (0–250μmolm−2s−1) and higher rL range ({$>$}150sm−1), rL was very sensitive to PPFD, as a small change in PPFD caused a large change in rL. PPFD alone explained 85\% of the variability in rc. The average root mean square difference between the measured and estimated rc was 11.1sm−1 (r2=0.93). Results are encouraging, as the integrated PPFD vs. rc approach to scale up rL to rc for non-stressed plants does not account for the effect of other factors such as vapor pressure deficit, carbon dioxide concentration, wind speed, and soil evaporation.},

  abstract = {Because of their overwhelming size over other organisms, trees define the structural and energetic properties of forest ecosystems. From grasslands to forests, leaf area index, which determines the amount of light energy intercepted for photosynthesis, increases with increasing canopy height across the various terrestrial ecosystems of the world. In vertically well-developed forests, niche differentiation along the vertical gradient of light availability may promote species coexistence. In addition, spatial and temporal differentiation of photosynthetic traits among the coexisting tree species (functional diversity) may promote complementary use of light energy, resulting in higher biomass and productivity in multi-species forests. Trees have evolved retaining high phenotypic plasticity because the spatial/temporal distribution of resources in forest ecosystems is highly heterogeneous and trees modify their own environment as they increase nearly 1,000 times in size through ontogeny. High phenotypic plasticity may enable coexistence of tree species through divergence in resource-rich environments, as well as through convergence in resource-limited environments. We propose that the breadth of individual-level phenotypic plasticity, expressed at the metamer level (leaves and shoots), is an important factor that promotes species coexistence and resource-use complementarity in forest ecosystems. A cross-biome comparison of the link between plasticity of photosynthesis-related traits and stand productivity will provide a functional explanation for the relationship between species assemblages and productivity of forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Mixed forests comprising multiple tree species with contrasting crown architectures, leaf phenologies, and photosynthetic activity, tend to have high ecosystem productivity. We propose that in such forests, differentiation among coexisting species in their spatial and temporal strategies for light interception, results in complementary use of light. Spatial differentiation among coexisting tree species occurs as a result of adaptation of crown architecture and shoot/leaf morphology to the spatially variable light conditions of the canopy, sub-canopy, and understory. Temporal differentiation occurs as a result of variation in leaf phenology and photosynthetic activity. The arrangement of leaves in both space and time is an important aspect of plant strategies for light interception and determines photosynthetic carbon gain of the plant canopy. For example, at the shoot level, morphological and phenological differentiation between long and short shoots reflects their respective shoot functions, indicating that spatial and temporal strategies for light interception are linked. Complementary use of light is a consequence of the spatiotemporal differentiation in light interception among coexisting species. Because coexisting species may show differentiation in strategies for resource acquisition (functional diversification) or convergence with respect to some limiting resource (functional convergence), the relative importance of various crown functions and their contribution to growth and survival of individuals need to be evaluated quantitatively and compared among coexisting species.},

  abstract = {Because rates of migration and genetic adaptation are slow, individual trees must initially acclimate to climate change via individual-level plasticity. Therefore, when predicting distribution and persistence of tree species under future climate change scenarios, we must take into account geographical variation in intra-individual plasticity. Here, we investigated geographical variation of intra-individual plasticity of Fagus crenata Blume (Japanese beech), a dominant species in late-successional, cool-temperate forests of Japan. We compared within-crown variation of leaf morphology (intra-crown leaf plasticity, ILP) among 13 sites across the full distribution range of F. crenata. Generally, ILP was lower for trees in the Pacific than Japan-Sea genetic lineages, low for trees in southern sites, and high for trees in sites near the northern and altitudinal range edges. Among the 13 sites, ILP was correlated with environmental variables associated with temperature. Positive correlation between ILP and temperature variation suggested that environmental perturbation selects for high intra-individual plasticity near northern and altitudinal range edges where F. crenata is expanding its distribution range. On the other hand, low ILP of trees in Pacific and southern sites, comprising geographically isolated populations, may reflect low acclimation potential to environmental perturbation. This could lead to local extinction if climatic conditions exceed the range of tolerance resulting in retreat of the Pacific and southern range edges of F. crenata in Japan.},

  abstract = {The study of leaf anatomy and of the mechanisms of the opening and closing of stomatal guard cells leads one to suppose that the stomata constitute the main or even the sole regulating system in leaf transpiration. Meteorologists have developed a wide variety of formulae for estimating evaporation from vegetation that are based entirely on weather variables and take no account at all of the species composition or stomatal properties of the transpiring vegetation. These “potential evaporation” formulae are widely and, to a large degree, successfully used for estimating evaporation from vegetation that is not water-stressed. Transpiration depends on stomatal conductance, net radiation receipt and upon air saturation deficit, temperature, and wind speed. Saturation deficit and wind speed vary through leaf boundary layers, through canopies, and through the atmosphere above the canopies. The sensitivity of saturation deficit to changes in stomatal conductance depends on where the saturation deficit is measured. If all of the stomata on a single leaf change aperture in unison, there may be a substantial change in saturation deficit measured at the leaf surface but a negligible change in saturation deficit measured a centimetre or two away, outside the leaf boundary layer.},

  abstract = {One of the most important and frequently studied variable in forests and the most basic element in governing transport processes of airflow is wind speed. The study of wind profile, defined as the change of wind velocity with height, and wind velocity are important because of tree physiological and developmental responses. Generally, wind profiles above the ground or at a canopy surface follow classical logarithm law, but wind profiles in a single tree and in a forest stand are not logarithmic. This paper summarizes the results of wind profile studies within a single tree, in a forest stand, above the forest canopy and in a forest area from recent research in a coastal pine forest. The results demonstrate that: 1) wind profiles with in a single conifer tree crown showed an exponential function with height, 2) wind profiles in forest stands were able to be expressed by attenuation coefficient of wind, 3) wind profiles over a forest canopy could be determined using profile parameters (friction velocity, roughness length and displacement), and 4) for a forest area, the extreme wind speed could be predicted reasonably using the methods developed for the design of buildings. More research will be required to demonstrate: 1) relationships between wind profiles and tree or stand characteristics, 2) the simple methods for predicting wind profile parameters, and 3) the applications of wind profile in studies of tree physiology, forest ecology and management, and the detail ecological effects of wind on tree growth.},

In this study, E O and E U of a temperate deciduous forest stand located in South Korea were measured during the growing season of 2008 using sap flow methods. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the total transpiration of the forest stand, i.e., overstory and understory, (2) to determine their relative contribution to ecosystem evapotranspiration (E eco), and (3) to identify factors controlling the transpiration of each layer. E O and E U were 174 and 22~mm, respectively. Total transpiration accounted for 55~\% of the total E eco, revealing the importance of unaccounted contributions to E eco (i.e., soil evaporation and wet canopy evaporation). During the monsoon period, there was a strong reduction in the total transpiration, likely because of reductions in photosynthetic active radiation, vapor pressure deficit and plant area index. The ratio of E U to E O declined during the same period, indicating an effect of monsoon on the partitioning of E eco in its two components. The seasonal pattern of E O was synchronized with the overstory canopy development, which equally had a strong regulatory influence on E U.},

  abstract = {The study of leaf functional trait relationships, the so-called leaf economics spectrum1,2, is based on the assumption of high-light conditions (as experienced by sunlit leaves). Owing to the exponential decrease of light availability through canopies, however, the vast majority of the world's vegetation exists in at least partial shade. Plant functional traits vary in direct dependence of light availability3, with different traits varying to different degrees, sometimes in conflict with expectations from the economic spectrum3. This means that the derived trait relationships of the global leaf economic spectrum are probably dependent on the extent to which observed data in existing large-scale plant databases represent high-light conditions. Here, using an extensive worldwide database of within-canopy gradients of key physiological, structural and chemical traits3, along with three different global trait databases4,5, we show that: (1) accounting for light-driven trait plasticity can reveal novel trait relationships, particularly for highly plastic traits (for example, the relationship between net assimilation rate per area (Aa) and leaf mass per area (LMA)); and (2) a large proportion of leaf traits in current global plant databases reported as measured in full sun were probably measured in the shade. The results show that even though the majority of leaves exist in the shade, along with a large proportion of observations, our current understanding is too focused on conditions in the sun.},

We tested one of the mechanisms underlying this interaction, the ‘low Ci effect’, in which stomatal closure in drought conditions reduces the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), resulting in a larger relative enhancement of photosynthesis with eCa, and, consequently, a larger relative biomass response. We grew two Eucalyptus species of contrasting drought tolerance at ambient and elevated Ca for 6–9 months in large pots maintained at 50\% (drought) and 100\% field capacity. Droughted plants did not have significantly lower Ci than well-watered plants, which we attributed to long-term changes in leaf area. Hence, there should not have been an interaction between eCa and water availability on biomass, and we did not detect one. The xeric species did have higher Ci than the mesic species, indicating lower water-use efficiency, but both species exhibited similar responses of photosynthesis and biomass to eCa, owing to compensatory differences in the photosynthetic response to Ci. Our results demonstrate that long-term acclimation to drought, and coordination among species traits may be important for predicting plant responses to eCa under low water availability.},

Here, we examined changes in leaf traits with forest height in diverse tree species and their role in environmental acclimation in a tropical rain forest in Borneo that does not experience dry spells. Height-related changes in leaf physiological and morphological traits [e.g., maximum photosynthetic rate (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), dark respiration rate (Rd), carbon isotope ratio (δ13C), nitrogen (N) content, and leaf mass per area (LMA)] from understory to emergent trees were investigated in 104 species in 29 families. We found that many leaf area-based physiological traits (e.g., Amax-area, Rd, gs), N, δ13C, and LMA increased linearly with tree height, while leaf mass-based physiological traits (e.g., Amax-mass) only increased slightly. These patterns differed from other biomes such as temperate and tropical dry forests, where trees usually show decreased photosynthetic capacity (e.g., Amax-area, Amax-mass) with height. Increases in photosynthetic capacity, LMA, and δ13C are favored under bright and dry upper canopy conditions with higher photosynthetic productivity and drought tolerance, whereas lower Rd and LMA may improve shade tolerance in lower canopy trees. Rapid recovery of leaf midday water potential to theoretical gravity potential during the night supports the idea that the majority of trees do not suffer from strong drought stress. Overall, leaf area-based photosynthetic traits were associated with tree height and the degree of leaf drought stress, even in diverse tropical rain forest trees.},

  abstract = {There is general concern that the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration will lead to reduced stomatal conductance and subsequent increases in leaf temperature. Such an increase in leaf temperature is expected to adversely impact a plethora of processes connected to leaf metabolism and microbial/fungal communities on leaves. A model is proposed that combines the leaf energy balance with leaf gas exchange and photosynthesis to explore such issues. The model represents a hybrid ecological/physiological approach described by systems of equations based on steady-state leaf-gas exchange theories and leaf energy/radiation balance, equilibrium thermodynamics within the leaf, stomatal data, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. The model allows separating air from leaf temperatures thereby permitting exploration of the dependence of leaf cooling or heating for any combination of environmental conditions (e.g., wind velocity, atmospheric humidity, and atmospheric CO2 level), anatomic leaf properties (e.g., leaf size), and physiologic quantities (e.g., assimilation rate and transpiration rate). The model permits to distinguish whether leaf cooling or heating is to be expected if these parameters are varied. Based on model calculations, it is shown that leaf temperature is far more impacted by leaf size or wind speed than reduction in stomatal conductance caused by elevated atmospheric CO2. The model results are consistent with measurements of leaf cooling and heating.},

  abstract = {1. Parameters of the photosynthesis vs CO2 response curve, nitrogen and chlorophyll contents were studied in Populus tremula, Tilia cordata and Corylus avellana leaves along a natural light gradient in the canopy. 2. In all species, leaf nitrogen content per unit area (Ns) declined with decreasing fractional transmission of photon flux density (Ksum), measured by a hemispheric photographic technique. However, the shape of the relationship between Ns and Ksum depended on species. Ns was almost linearly related to Ksum in the most light-demanding species P. tremula but this relationship was curved in two other species. Populus tremula possessed the largest values of Ns at given Ksum, while C. avellana, the most shade-tolerant species, had the lowest values of Ns. 3. Both the initial slope, characterizing the maximum carboxylation efficiency, and the plateau value, providing an estimate of the photosynthetic electron transport capacity, of the photosynthesis vs CO2 response curves, were linearly related to Ns and only minor differences were observed among the studied species. Leaf chlorophyll content per area was also related to Ns but the ratio of Chl/N increased substantially at low Ksum in the lower canopy. It was concluded that the partitioning of nitrogen between light harvesting, electron transport and carboxylation components of the photosynthetic apparatus may change with depth in the canopy as a result of a relative increase in the light-harvesting complexes in relation to the rest of the photosynthetic apparatus. 4. The interspecific differences in species’ photosynthetic potentials are mainly associated with different nitrogen distribution patterns along the canopy and in minor part with differences in nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic machinery.},

  abstract = {Abstract Phenotypic plasticity and developmental instability in leaf traits are common in oak species but the role of environmental factors is not well understood. To decipher possible correlations between different leaf traits and effects of the position of leaves within the tree canopy, we quantified the plasticity of three leaf traits of 30 trees of Quercus alba L., Quercus palustris Muench and Quercus velutina Lam. We hypothesized that trees could modify the shape of their leaves for better adaptation to the variable microclimate within the canopy. Our results demonstrated that the south and north outer leaves were significantly smaller, more lobed and denser than those situated in the inner canopy. The order of leaves on the branch accounted for the plasticity of leaf traits in Q. alba only. Plasticity of lobing in Q. alba and Q. velutina depended on the height of the trees. We detected fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in all three species, but the source of variation depended on branch position in Q. velutina only. FA was more pronounced in north-facing leaves. Plasticity of the leaf traits ranged from small to medium. Plasticity of leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA) depended on the branch position. However, the plasticity of lobation was not affected by the location of a branch within the tree canopy. Quercus alba and Q. palustris had similar plastic responses but the plasticity of Q. velutina was significantly smaller. We concluded that individual plants detect and cope with environmental stress through vegetative organ modification.},

  abstract = {Thermal macrophysiology is an established research field that has led to well-described patterns in the global structuring of climate adaptation and risk. However, since it was developed primarily in animals, we lack information on how general these patterns are across organisms. This is alarming if we are to understand how thermal tolerances are distributed globally, improve predictions of climate change, and mitigate effects. We approached this knowledge gap by compiling a geographically and taxonomically extensive database on plant heat and cold tolerances and used this dataset to test for thermal macrophysiological patterns and processes in plants. We found support for several expected patterns: Cold tolerances are more variable and exhibit steeper latitudinal clines and stronger relationships with local environmental temperatures than heat tolerances overall. Next, we disentangled the importance of local environments and evolutionary and biogeographic histories in generating these patterns. We found that all three processes have significantly contributed to variation in both heat and cold tolerances but that their relative importance differs. We also show that failure to simultaneously account for all three effects overestimates the importance of the included variable, challenging previous conclusions drawn from less comprehensive models. Our results are consistent with rare evolutionary innovations in cold acclimation ability structuring plant distributions across biomes. In contrast, plant heat tolerances vary mainly as a result of biogeographical processes and drift. Our results further highlight that all plants, particularly at mid-to-high latitudes and in their nonhardened state, will become increasingly vulnerable to ongoing climate change.},

  abstract = {In the field, leaves may face very different light intensities within the tree canopy. Leaves usually respond with light-induced morphological and photosynthetic changes, in a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity. Canopy light distribution, leaf anatomy, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and pigment composition were investigated in an olive (Olea europaea, cvs. Arbequina and Arbosana) orchard planted with a high-density system (1,250~trees~ha−1). Sampling was made from three canopy zones: a lower canopy ({$<$}1~m), a central one (1–2~m), and an upper one ({$>$}2~m). Light interception decreased significantly in the lower canopy when compared to the central and top ones. Leaf angle increased and photosynthetic rates and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) decreased significantly and progressively from the upper canopy to the central and the lower canopies. The largest leaf areas were found in the lower canopy, especially in the cultivar Arbequina. The palisade and spongy parenchyma were reduced in thickness in the lower canopy when compared to the upper one, in the former due to a decrease in the number of cell layers from three to two (clearly distinguishable in the light and fluorescence microscopy images). In both cultivars, the concentration of violaxanthin-cycle pigments and β-carotene was higher in the upper than in the lower canopy. Furthermore, the de-epoxidized forms zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin increased significantly in those leaves from the upper canopy, in parallel to the NPQ increases. In conclusion, olive leaves react with morphological and photosynthetic changes to within-crown light gradients. These results strengthen the idea of olive trees as “modular organisms” that adjust the modules morphology and physiology in response to light intensity.},

  abstract = {Niche differentiation is a key issue in the current debate on community assembly mechanisms. In highly diverse moist tropical forests, tree species sensitivity to canopy openness is thought to be a major axis in niche differentiation. In the past, the syndrome of traits driving the demographic trade-off involved in the niche-based theory of coexistence has always been established among species situated at the two extremities of the shade-tolerance gradient, even though most tropical tree species have intermediate light requirements. In addition, trait plasticity has seldom been linked to tropical tree species distribution along environmental gradients. This article examines covariations between leaf traits, whole-plant traits and niche parameters among 14 tree species with intermediate light requirements in French Guiana and across a range of canopy openness. Each functional trait measured under field conditions was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Niche differentiation was characterized in terms of spatial light gradient. We first examined covariations between functional traits then explored to what degree the median value and plasticity in functional traits could predict light niche characteristics at the sapling stage and the ontogenetic change in light availability estimated by adult stature. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was positively correlated with leaf life span (LLS); species with higher LMA and higher LLS displayed lower diameter growth rates (GRs) and lower responsiveness to canopy gap at both whole-plant and population levels. This proved that the relationships previously established over a broader range of species held true within the narrow range of the light requirements covered. Height GR plasticity accounted for 49\% of the variation in light niche optimum. LMA plasticity, unlike LLS plasticity, was significantly correlated with light niche breadth and adult stature. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the relevance of considering the phenotypic plasticity in functional traits in community ecology, particularly for quantifying breadth of species distribution over environmental gradients. Our findings did not support Hubbell's hypothesis of functional equivalence and suggest that even a rather subtle variation in forest canopy disturbance promotes the coexistence of tropical tree species.},

  abstract = {The survival of dipterocarp seedlings in the understorey of south-east Asian rain forests is limited by their ability to maintain a positive carbon balance. Photosynthesis during sunflecks is an important component of carbon gain. Field measurements demonstrated that Shorea leprosula seedlings in a rain forest understorey received a high proportion of daily photon flux density at temperatures supra-optimal for photosynthesis (72\% at ≥30 °C, 14\% at ≥35 °C). To investigate the effect of high temperatures on photosynthesis during sunflecks, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made on seedlings grown in controlled environment conditions either, under uniform, saturating irradiance (approximately 539 µmol m−2 s−1) or, shade/fleck sequences (approximately 30 µmol m−2 s−1/approximately 525 µmol m−2 s−1) at two temperatures, 28 or 38 °C. The rate of light-saturated photosynthesis, under uniform irradiance, was inhibited by 40\% at 38 °C compared with 28 °C. However, during the shade/fleck sequence, photosynthesis was inhibited by 59\% at 38 °C compared with 28 °C. The greater inhibition of photosynthesis during the shade/fleck sequence, when compared with uniform irradiance, was driven by the lower efficiency of dynamic photosynthesis combined with lower steady-state rates of photosynthesis. These results suggest that, contrary to current dogma, sunfleck activity may not always result in significant carbon gain. This has important consequences for seedling regeneration processes in tropical forests as well as for leaves in other canopy positions where sunflecks make an important contribution to total photon flux density.},

Unlike artificial leaves, however, spatial temperature distribution in large leaves appeared to be governed largely by structural variation. Therefore, we agree that small size, specifically we, has adaptive value in hot environments but not with the idea that thermal regulation is the primary evolutionary driver of leaf dissection.},

  abstract = {Tropical plant species are expected to have high heat tolerance reflecting phenotypic adjustments to warm regions or their evolutionary adaptation history. However, tropical highland specialists adapted to the colder temperatures found in the highlands, where short and prostrated vegetation decouples plants from ambient conditions, could exhibit different upper thermal limits than those of their lowland counterparts. Here we evaluated leaf heat tolerance of 21 tropical alpine paramo species to determine: 1) whether species with restricted distribution (i.e., highland specialists) have lower heat tolerance and are more vulnerable to warming than species with widespread distribution; 2) whether different growth forms have different heat tolerance; and 3) whether species height (i.e., microhabitat) influences its heat tolerance. We quantified heat tolerance by evaluating T50, which is the temperature that causes a reduction in 50\% of initial Fv/Fm values and reflects an irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Additionally, we estimated the thermal safety margins as the difference between T50 and the maximum leaf temperature registered for the species. All species presented high T50 values ranging between 45.4°C and 53.9°C, similar to those found for tropical lowland species. Heat tolerance was not correlated with species distributions or plant height, but showed a strong relationship with growth form, with rosettes having the highest heat tolerance. Thermal safety margins ranged from 12.1 to 31.0°C. High heat tolerance and broad thermal safety margins suggest low vulnerability of paramo species to warming as long as plants are capable of regulating the leaf temperature within this threshold. Whether paramo plants would be able to regulate leaf temperature if drought episodes become more frequent and transpirational cooling is compromised is the next question that needs to be answered.},

  abstract = {• Reflectance indices are frequently used for the nondestructive assessment of leaf chemistry, especially pigment content, in environmental or developmental studies. Since reflectance spectra are influenced by trichome density, and trichome density displays a considerable phenotypic plasticity, we asked whether this structural parameter could be a source of variation in the values of the most commonly used indices. • Trichome density was manipulated in detached leaves of three species having either peltate (Olea europaea and Elaeagnus angustifolius) or tubular (Populus alba) trichomes by successive removal of hairs. After each dehairing step, trichome density was determined by light or scanning electron microscopy and reflectance spectra were obtained with a diode-array spectrometer. • Although species-specific differences were evident, most of the indices were considerably affected even at low trichome densities. In general, the less-affected indices were those using wavebands within the visible spectral region. The index that could be safely used even at very high hair densities in all species was the red edge index (λRE) for chlorophyll. • The results indicate that changes in reflectance indices should be interpreted cautiously when concurrent changes in trichome density are suspected. In this case, the red edge for chlorophyll content may be the index of choice.},

Sarg.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) trees growing in a 400–500-year-old mixed species stand. We determined: (1) whether light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates varied from the upper to the lower canopy, and (2) if light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates varied between Douglas-fir and western hemlock. Over a 25-m gradient from the canopy top to the lower canopy, mean light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates declined in overstory Douglas-fir and western hemlock needles, paralleling a 65\% decline in the mean daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). At the canopy top, increasing light-saturated photosynthetic rates relative to lower canopy needles increased carbon uptake at high PPFD. In the lower canopy, reduced respiration rates relative to upper canopy needles increased carbon uptake at low PPFD by reducing the light compensation point. At all canopy positions, western hemlock had lower mean light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points and respiration rates than Douglas-fir. As a result, western hemlock had higher net photosynthetic rates at low PPFD, but lower net photosynthetic rates at high PPFD compared with Douglas-fir.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Gross primary production (GPP) in forests is the most important carbon flux in terrestrial ecosystems. Forest ecosystems with high leaf area index (LAI) values have diverse species or complex forest structures with vertical stratifications that influence the carbon\&ndash;water\&ndash;energy cycles. In this study, we used three light use efficiency (LUE) GPP models and site-level experiment data to analyze the effects of the vertical stratification of dense forest vegetation on the estimates of remotely sensed GPP during the growing season of two forest sites in East Asia: Dinghushan (DHS) and Tomakomai (TMK). The results showed that different controlling environmental factors of the vertical layers, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), produce different responses for the same LUE value in the different sub-ecosystems (defined as the tree, shrub, and grass layers), which influences the GPP estimation. Air temperature and VPD play important roles in the effects of vertical stratification on the GPP estimates in dense forests, which led to differences in GPP uncertainties from \&minus;50\% to 30\% because of the distinct temperature responses in TMK. The unequal vertical LAI distributions in the different sub-ecosystems led to GPP variations of 1\&ndash;2 gC/m2/day with uncertainties of approximately \&minus;30\% to 20\% because sub-ecosystems have unique absorbed fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and LUE. A comparison with the flux tower-based GPP data indicated that the GPP estimations from the LUE and APAR values from separate vertical layers exhibited better model performance than those calculated using the single-layer method, with 10\% less bias in DHS and more than 70\% less bias in TMK. The precision of the estimated GPP in regions with thick understory vegetation could be effectively improved by considering the vertical variations in environmental parameters and the LAI values of different sub-ecosystems as separate factors when calculating the GPP of different components. Our results provide useful insight that can be used to improve the accuracy of remote sensing GPP estimations by considering vertical stratification parameters along with the LAI of sub-ecosystems in dense forests.},

Across forests, GPP was positively correlated with community-averaged Chl (r = 0.57; P {$<$} 0.01), a new case of a linkage between leaf traits and ecosystem function at regional to continental scale. Our findings revealed variation in Chl from tropical to cold-temperate forests, and the linkage of leaf Chl with ecosystem function, enhancing our ability to parameterize vegetation models.},

  abstract = {Ongoing climate warming induced by human activities may have great impacts on trees, yet it remains unresolved how subtropical tree species respond to rising temperature in the field. Here, we used downward translocation to investigate the effects of climate warming on leaf photosynthesis of six common tree species in subtropical China. During the experimental period between 2012 and 2014, the mean average photosynthetic rates (Asat) under saturating light for Schima superba, Machilus breviflora, Pinus massoniana and Ardisia lindleyana in the warm site were7\%, 19\%, 20\% and 29\% higher than those in the control site. In contrast, seasonal Asat for Castanopsis hystrix in the warm site were lower compared to the control site. Changes in Asat in response to translocation were mainly associated with those in leaf stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic capacity (RuBP carboxylation, RuBP regeneration capacity). Our results imply that climate warming could have potential impacts on species composition and community structure in subtropical forests.},

Our model suggests that although reductions in photosynthetic rate at leaf temperatures (TL) above 30°C may occur, these are almost entirely accountable for in terms of reductions in stomatal conductance in response to higher leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficits D. This is as opposed to direct effects of TL on photosynthetic metabolism. We also find that increases in photosynthetic rates associated with increases in ambient [CO2] over forthcoming decades should more than offset any decline in photosynthetic productivity due to higher D or TL or increased autotrophic respiration rates as a consequence of higher tissue temperatures. We also find little direct evidence that tropical forests should not be able to respond to increases in [CO2] and argue that the magnitude and pattern of increases in forest dynamics across Amazonia observed over the last few decades are consistent with a [CO2]-induced stimulation of tree growth.},

  abstract = {The unique terrain, geography, and climate patterns of the eastern United States encourage periodic occurrences of catastrophic ice storms capable of large-scale damage or destruction of forests. However, the pervasive and persistent effects of these glaze events on regional forest distribution and composition have rarely been studied. In the southeastern US, ice storm frequency and intensity increase with increasing latitude and along the complex gradients from the coast (low, flat, sediment controlled and temperature moderated near the ocean) to the interior (high, rugged, bedrock controlled, distant from warming ocean). To investigate the potential influence of this disturbance gradient on regional forest composition, we studied the differential responses of trees (canopy position, lifeform group, and species group) to a particularly severe ice storm. Our results indicated that tree mortality and damage (canopy damage, bent bole, snapped bole, and uprooted) varied significantly between overstory and understory trees, and among species and lifeform groups. Overstory trees were more prone to glaze damage than understory trees, and evergreen broadleaf species were the most susceptible to glaze damage, while deciduous species were the least susceptible. Among the pine species studied, slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) and longleaf pine (P. palustris Mill.) suffered more severe damage and mortality than loblolly pine (P. taeda L.). Further, ice damage was correlated with distribution-based differences in injury susceptibility among pine and deciduous tree species. The most ice storm-tolerant pine species, loblolly pine, had the most northerly distribution (39.51°N), while the least resistant species were those with more southerly distribution (e.g., 33.29°N for slash pine). These results support hypotheses that the distributions of evergreen tree species are regulated by periodic catastrophic ice storms. Therefore, predicting future distributions of tree species in response to climate change should consider the role of ice storms in shaping the forest composition.},

  abstract = {It was predicted that relationships of leaf mass per area (LMA) with juvenile shade tolerance will depend on leaf habit, and on whether species are compared at a common age as young seedlings, or at a common size as saplings. A meta-analysis of 47 comparative studies (372 species) was used to test predictions, and the effect of light environment on this relationship. The LMA of evergreens was positively correlated with shade tolerance, irrespective of ontogeny or light environment. The LMA of young seedlings (≤ 1 yr) of deciduous species in low light was also positively correlated with shade tolerance; more weakly so in high light. By contrast, size-specific comparisons of deciduous saplings gave negative correlations of LMA with shade tolerance. Independent contrasts and cross-species analyses yielded broadly similar results. We conclude that ontogeny strongly influences the relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous trees, but has little impact on that of evergreens. Size-specific comparisons reveal opposing trends in deciduous and evergreen taxa: the negative relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous species is probably dominated by interspecific differences in palisade thickness, whereas patterns in evergreens are probably shaped more by the degree of structural reinforcement, linked to wide variation in leaf lifespan.},

  abstract = {Functional traits respond to environmental drivers, hence evaluating trait-environment relationships across spatial environmental gradients can help to understand how multiple drivers influence plant communities. Global-change drivers such as changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition occur worldwide, but affect community trait distributions at the local scale, where resources (e.g. light availability) and conditions (e.g. soil pH) also influence plant communities. We investigate how multiple environmental drivers affect community trait responses related to resource acquisition (plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), woodiness, and mycorrhizal status) and regeneration (seed mass, lateral spread) of European temperate deciduous forest understoreys. We sampled understorey communities and derived trait responses across spatial gradients of global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and past land use), while integrating in-situ plot measurements on resources and conditions (soil type, Olsen phosphorus (P), Ellenberg soil moisture, light, litter mass, and litter quality). Among the global-change drivers, mean annual temperature strongly influenced traits related to resource acquisition. Higher temperatures were associated with taller understoreys producing leaves with lower SLA, and a higher proportional cover of woody and obligate mycorrhizal (OM) species. Communities in plots with higher Ellenberg soil moisture content had smaller seeds and lower proportional cover of woody and OM species. Finally, plots with thicker litter layers hosted taller understoreys with larger seeds and a higher proportional cover of OM species. Our findings suggest potential community shifts in temperate forest understoreys with global warming, and highlight the importance of local resources and conditions as well as global-change drivers for community trait variation.},

  abstract = {The transpiration of a mature beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest was measured over a whole season by the heat pulse velocity technique and the results analysed in terms of a new analytical canopy conductance model, which takes into account the effects of partial decoupling from the atmosphere on the local humidity environment experienced by the canopy. Stand daily transpiration ranged from 0·62 to 2·97 mm d–1, with a seasonal mean value of 1·97 mm d–1. Maximum canopy conductance was 18·5 mm s–1, with a mean estimated value of 5·0 mm s–1; computed values were little affected by the assumption of neutral atmospheric conditions. The decoupling coefficient Ω varied greatly on a daily and seasonal basis, with an average value of 0·28. As a result of partial decoupling, the estimated vapour pressure deficit at the notional canopy surface exceeded the values measured above the canopy by 380 Pa on average. When correctly expressed in terms of humidity at the canopy surface, the model explained 80\% of the variance in half-hourly transpiration measurements. Upon cross-validation it still explained 72\% of the variance, as compared to only 40\% when correction for partial decoupling was not introduced. A baseline canopy conductance of 0·7 mm s–1, not modulated by the environment, was estimated. The implications of the model are discussed for the representation of canopy conductance and transpiration of broad-leaf forests.},

We asked whether carbon reserves decrease in resource stressed seedlings, and if NSC allocation is related to species' relative stress tolerances. We tested the effects of stress (shade, drought, and defoliation) on NSC in seedlings of five temperate tree species (Acer rubrum  Marsh., Betula papyrifera  Marsh., Fraxinus americana  L ., Quercus rubra  L., and Quercus velutina  Lam.). In a greenhouse experiment, seedlings were subjected to combinations of shade, drought, and defoliation. We harvested seedlings over 32–97~days and measured biomass and NSC concentrations in stems and roots to estimate depletion rates. For all species and treatments, except for defoliation, seedling growth and NSC accumulation ceased. Shade and drought combined caused total NSC decreases in all species. For shade or drought alone, only some species experienced decreases. Starch followed similar patterns as total NSC, but soluble sugars increased under drought for drought‐tolerant species. These results provide evidence that species deplete stored carbon in response to carbon limiting stress and that species differences in NSC response may be important for understanding carbon depletion as a buffer against shade‐ and drought‐induced mortality.},

  abstract = {Information on understory composition and its relationships with the overstory tree canopy, especially leaf area index (LAI), is crucially needed in, e.g., modeling land-atmosphere interactions and productivity of forests. There are also several global LAI products produced from satellite data which need to be validated with ground reference data. However, to date, only scarce field data on simultaneous structural properties of under- and overstory vegetation, and tree canopy LAI, have been available in boreal forests. This paper shows how understory composition and fractional cover of different species types varies in a boreal forest site, and how it is linked to structural properties of the tree layer. The study is based on 301 understory plots collected in an area of ∼16 km2 around Hyytiälä forestry field station, Finland (61°50′N, 24°17′E) in a southern boreal forest site. Forest understory plot data was accompanied with measurements of both standard forest inventory variables and optically-based canopy light transmittance data. Clear differences in average species composition between different site fertility types were observed, but also large variation within each site fertility type was noted. Forest understory composition was better correlated with structural forest canopy measures (e.g., tree canopy LAI, canopy cover, canopy openness) than with traditional forest inventory variables such as tree height or diameter. Forest canopy LAI and the fractional cover of understory were strongly related, especially in more fertile sites. Our results highlight the role of tree canopy structural metrics as modifiers of the understory light climate and growing conditions, also, in boreal forests.},

  abstract = {Foliar trait adaptation to sun and shade has been extensively studied in the context of photosynthetic performance of plants, focusing on nitrogen allocation, light capture and use via chlorophyll pigments and leaf morphology; however, less is known about the potential sun-shade dichotomy of other functionally important foliar traits. In this study, we measured 19 traits in paired sun and shade leaves along a 3,500-m elevation gradient in southern Peru to test whether the traits differ with canopy position, and to assess if relative differences vary with species composition and/or environmental filters. We found significant sun-shade differences in leaf mass per area (LMA), photosynthetic pigments (Chl ab and Car), and d13C. Sun-shade offsets among these traits remained constant with elevation, soil substrates, and species compositional changes. However, other foliar traits related to structure and chemical defense, and those defining general metabolic processes, did not differ with canopy position. Our results suggest that whole-canopy function is captured in many traits of sun leaves; however, photosynthesis-related traits must be scaled based on canopy light extinction. These findings show that top-of-canopy measurements of foliar chemistry from spectral remote sensing approaches map directly to whole-canopy foliar traits including shaded leaves that cannot be directly observed from above.},

  abstract = {It has long been held that the low photosynthetic rates (A) of coffee leaves are largely associated with diffusive constraints to photosynthesis. However, the relative limitations of the stomata and mesophyll to the overall diffusional constraints to photosynthesis, as well as the coordination of leaf hydraulics with photosynthetic limitations, remain to be fully elucidated in coffee. Whether the low actual A under ambient CO2 concentrations is associated with the kinetic properties of Rubisco and high (photo)respiration rates also remains elusive. Here, we provide a holistic analysis to understand the causes associated with low A by measuring a variety of key anatomical/hydraulic and photosynthetic traits in sun- and shade-grown coffee plants. We demonstrate that leaf hydraulic architecture imposes a major constraint on the maximisation of the photosynthetic gas exchange of coffee leaves. Regardless of the light treatments, A was mainly limited by stomatal factors followed by similar limitations associated with the mesophyll and biochemical constraints. No evidence of an inefficient Rubisco was found; rather, we propose that coffee Rubisco is well tuned for operating at low chloroplastic CO2 concentrations. Finally, we contend that large diffusive resistance should lead to large CO2 drawdown from the intercellular airspaces to the sites of carboxylation, thus favouring the occurrence of relatively high photorespiration rates, which ultimately leads to further limitations to A.},

  abstract = {In a context of urban warming, the effects of trees on outdoor thermal stress are important even during the increasingly hot autumn season. This study examines the effects of a deciduous tree species (Tilia x europaea L) on surface temperature over different ground materials and in turn on human thermal comfort, with a particular focus on tree shade variation due to leaf fall. Grass, asphalt, and gravel-covered ground surfaces, both sun-exposed and under the Tilia, were monitored in Florence, Italy, during the summer (2014) and autumn (2017) seasons. The Index of Thermal Stress (ITS) was used to gauge the micrometeorological effects of the changing tree canopy, with tree defoliation quantified by the Plant Area Index. On clear summer days, thermal discomfort was especially pronounced over exposed asphalt, and even more intense above exposed gravel due to its higher reflectivity-while shaded surfaces showed large reductions in thermal stress. Even though incoming solar radiation decreases over the course of the fall season, the direct radiation under the gradually defoliating tree canopy actually increases. Due to this diminished shading effect, the differences in surface temperature between exposed and shaded asphalt shrink dramatically from about 20 to 3~°C. However, since ambient conditions become milder as the season progresses, the Tilia demonstrated a double benefit in terms of ITS: providing thermal comfort under its full canopy at the beginning of autumn and maintaining comfort even as its canopy thins out. At the same time, tree species with earlier defoliation may be unable to replicate such benefits.},

  abstract = {Tropical tree species have evolved under very narrow temperature ranges compared to temperate forest species. Studies suggest that tropical trees may be more vulnerable to continued warming compared to temperate species, as tropical trees have shown declines in growth and photosynthesis at elevated temperatures. However, regional and global vegetation models lack the data needed to accurately represent such physiological responses to increased temperatures, especially for tropical forests. To address this need, we compared instantaneous photosynthetic temperature responses of mature canopy foliage, leaf temperatures, and air temperatures across vertical canopy gradients in three forest types: tropical wet, tropical moist, and temperate deciduous. Temperatures at which maximum photosynthesis occurred were greater in the tropical forests canopies than the temperate canopy (30 ± 0.3 ◦C vs. 27 ± 0.4 ◦C). However, contrary to expectations that tropical species would be functioning closer to threshold temperatures, photosynthetic temperature optima was exceeded by maximum daily leaf temperatures, resulting in sub-optimal rates of carbon assimilation for much of the day, especially in upper canopy foliage ({$>$}10 m). If trees are unable to thermally acclimate to projected elevated temperatures, these forests may shift from net carbon sinks to sources, with potentially dire implications to climate feedbacks and forest community composition.},

Conclusions 15 Acknowledgements 15 References 15 Summary Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure.

  abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health, productivity, and demography. Knowing precisely how trees' grow within a year, instead of across years, can lead to a finer understanding of the mechanisms that drive these larger patterns. The growing use of dendrometer bands in research forests has only rarely been used to measure growth at resolutions finer than yearly, but intra-annual growth patterns can be observed from dendrometer bands using precision digital calipers and weekly measurements. Here we present a workflow to help forest ecologists fit growth models to intra-annual measurements using standard optimization functions provided by the R platform. We explain our protocol, test uncertainty in parameter estimates with respect to sample sizes, extend the optimization protocol to estimate robust lower and upper annual diameter bounds, and discuss potential challenges to optimal fits. We offer R code to implement this workflow. We found that starting values and initial optimization routines are critical to fitting the best functional forms. After using a bounded, broad search method, a more focused search algorithm obtained consistent results. To estimate starting and ending annual diameters, we combined the growth function with early and late estimates of beginning and ending growth. Once we fit the functions, we present extension algorithms that estimate periodic reductions in growth, total growth, and present a method of controlling for the shifting allocation to girth during the growth season. We demonstrate that with these extensions, an analysis of growth response to weather (e.g., the water available to a tree) can be derived in a way that is comparable across trees, years, and sites. Thus, this approach, when applied across broader data sets, offers a pathway to build inference about the effects of seasonal weather on growth, size- and light-dependent patterns of growth, species-specific patterns, and phenology.},

The coefficient of variation in \%PPFD measured in the nine locations within each stand was significantly lower under deciduous dominated forests (mean of 19\%) than under coniferous dominated forests (mean of 40\%). \%PPFD measured at the forest floor was positively correlated with \%PPFD measured above the understory vegetation and negatively correlated with cumulative total percent cover of the understory vegetation (R2 = 0.852). The proportion of sunflecks above 250 and 500 mmol m–2 s–1 was much lower and \%PPFD in shade much higher under Populus and Betula forests than under the other forests. Differences in the mean, variability and nature of the light environment found among forest and soil types are discussed in relation to their possible influences on tree succession.},

  abstract = {Building a more predictive trait-based ecology requires mechanistic theory based on first principles. We present a general theoretical approach to link traits and climate. We use plant leaves to show how energy budgets (i) provide a foundation for understanding thermoregulation, (ii) explain mechanisms driving trait variation across environmental gradients, and (iii) guide selection on functional traits via carbon economics. Although plants are often considered to be poikilotherms, the data suggest that they are instead limited homeotherms. Leaf functional traits that promote limited homeothermy are adaptive because homeothermy maximizes instantaneous and lifetime carbon gain. This theory provides a process-based foundation for trait–climate analyses and shows that future studies should consider plant (not only air) temperatures.},

  abstract = {Plant isoprene emissions have been linked to several reaction pathways involved in atmospheric photochemistry. Evidence exists from a limited set of past observations that isoprene emission rate (Is) decreases as a function of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that increased temperature suppresses the CO2 effect. We studied interactions between intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and temperature as they affect Is in field-grown hybrid poplar trees in one of the warmest climates on earth – the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States. We observed an unexpected midsummer downregulation of Is despite the persistence of relatively high temperatures. High temperature suppression of the Is:Ci relation occurred at all times during the growing season, but sensitivity of Is to increased Ci was greatest during the midsummer period when Is was lowest. We interpret the seasonal downregulation of Is and increased sensitivity of Is to Ci as being caused by weather changes associated with the onset of a regional monsoon system. Our observations on the temperature suppression of the Is:Ci relation are best explained by the existence of a small pool of chloroplastic inorganic phosphate, balanced by several large, connected metabolic fluxes, which together, determine the Ci and temperature dependencies of phosphoenolpyruvate import into the chloroplast.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Microclimatic variability in tropical forests plays a key role in shaping species distributions and their ability to cope with environmental change, especially for ectotherms. Yet, currently available climatic datasets lack data from the forest interior and our knowledge of thermal tolerance among tropical ectotherms is limited. To tackle this, we studied natural variation in the microclimate experienced by a tropical genus of butterflies (\emph{Heliconius} sp.) along their Andean range across a single year. We found that the forest strongly buffers temperature and humidity in the understory, especially in the lowlands where temperatures are more extreme. There were systematic differences between our yearly records and macroclimate databases (WorldClim2), with lower interpolated minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures higher than expected. We then assessed thermal tolerance of ten \emph{Heliconius} butterfly species in the wild and showed that populations at high elevations had significantly lower heat tolerance than those at lower elevations. However, when we reared populations of the widespread \emph{H. erato} from high and low elevations in a common-garden environment, the difference in heat tolerance across elevations was reduced, indicating plasticity in this trait. Microclimate buffering is not currently captured in publicly available datasets but could be crucial for enabling upland shifting of species sensitive to heat such as highland \emph{Heliconius}. Plasticity in thermal tolerance may alleviate the effects of global warming on some widespread ectotherm species, but more research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of plasticity on populations and species.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Summary statement{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Tropical forests along the Andes were found to greatly buffer climate.

Midway through the summer, we transferred potted, shade-grown seedlings of four co-occurring temperature deciduous tree species representing a range of shade-tolerance categories and leaf production strategies to gaps. Shade-tolerant Acer saccharum was the least responsive to gap conditions. It produced few new, high-light acclimated leaves and increases in photosynthetic rates of shade-developed leaves appeared stomatally limited. Intermediately shade-tolerant Fraxinus americana and Quercus rubra responded most, by producing new leaves and increasing photosynthetic rates of existing shade-developed leaves to levels not significantly different from gap-grown controls within four weeks of gap exposure. Shade-intolerant Liriodendron tulipifera was intermediate in response. In these species, the degree of shoot-level morphological acclimation (new leaf production) and leaf-level physiological acclimation (photosynthetic increases in existing leaves) appear coupled. Mechanisms of acclimation also appear related to intrinsic patterns of nitrogen use and mobilization, the ability to adjust stomatal conductance, and shade tolerance.},

The short-term metabolic modulation after plant exposure to heat and cold, including chilling and freezing, is discussed. Effects on photosynthesis, cell membranes, antioxidant system, production of heat shock proteins and nitric oxide, as well as an overview of signaling events to heat or cold stress are presented. In addition, we also discuss the acclimation process that occurs when the plant acquires resistance to an increase or decrease in temperature, adjusting its homeostasis and steady-state physiology to the new temperatures. Finally, we present studies with tropical plants that aim at elucidating the effects of temperature and the identification of the resilience levels of these plants to the expected climate changes, and which seek the development of techniques for germplasm conservation of endangered species.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that in temperate deciduous trees acclimation to potentially damaging high irradiances occurs via long-term adjustments in foliar photosynthetic capacity, and short-term changes in xanthophyll cycle pool size in response to weather fluctuations, nitrogen concentration and pigment composition were examined along a canopy light gradient in three species –Betula pendula, Populus tremula and Tilia cordata (from most shade intolerant to tolerant), and foliage photosynthetic potentials in P. tremula and T. cordata. Integrated quantum flux density (Qi) incident on leaves was estimated with a method combining hemispherical photography and light measurements with quantum sensors made over the growing season. Long- and short-term light indices – average total seasonal daily integrated quantum flux density (Ts, mol m–2 d–1) and that of the 3 d preceding foliage sampling (T3d) – were calculated for each sampled leaf. In addition to total integrated quantum flux density, the part of Qi attributable to direct flux was also computed. Strong linear relationships between the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport per area (Jamax), estimated from in situ measurements of effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PS II), and Qi averaged over the season and over the preceding 3 d were found for all studied species. However, the major determinant of Jamax, the product of electron transport capacity per leaf dry mass (Jmmax) and leaf dry mass per area (MA), was MA rather than Jmmax, which was relatively constant along the light gradient. There was evidence that Jamax is more tightly related to Ts, which characterizes the light climate during foliar development, than to short-term integrated light, possibly because there is little flexibility in adjustments in MA after the completion of foliar growth. Leaf chlorophyll concentrations and the investment of leaf nitrogen in chlorophyll (Chl/N) were negatively related to Qi– an investment pattern which improves light harvesting in low light. Xanthophyll cycle pool size (VAZ, violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin) either expressed per unit chlorophyll (VAZ/Chl) or as a fraction of total carotenoids (VAZ/Car) increased with increasing Qi in all species. However, contrary to Jamax, it tended to correlate more strongly with short-term than with long-term average integrated light. There were few interspecific differences in Jamax, Chl/N, VAZ/Chl and VAZ/Car when the variability in light level incident to the leaves was accounted for, indicating that the foliage of both shade-intolerant and -tolerant temperate tree species possesses considerable phenotypic flexibility. Collectively these results support the view that rapid adjustment of the xanthophyll cycle pool size provides an important means for acclimation to light fluctuations in a time scale of days, during which the potential for photosynthetic quenching of excitation energy is not likely to change appreciably.},

The leaves of sub-canopy species T. cordata were on average exposed to lower irradiances, and they were also more horizontal with greater blade inclination angles (ϕB, defined as the angle between the leaf fall-line and the horizon; ϕB was positive for the leaves inclined upwards, and negative for the leaves inclined downwards) than those in P. tremula. Seasonal average daily integrated quantum flux density (Qint, mol m–2 day–1) and ϕB were not related in T. cordata, and only a weak negative effect of Qint on ϕB was detected in P. tremula. Nevertheless, when both species were pooled, there was a strong negative relationship between Qint and ϕB, implying that the leaves became progressively vertical with increasing height in the canopy. Interspecific differences in foliage inclination were mainly related to petiole morphology, in particular to petiole length, rather than to contrasting biomass investment patterns between assimilative and support tissues within the leaf. It was suggested that more horizontal leaves, resulting from the species-specific structure of petioles, partly explain the superior performance of shade-tolerant T. cordata in the understory and the sub-canopy.},

  abstract = {Intercellular CO2 mole fractions (Ci) are lower in the upper canopy relative to the lower canopy leaves. This canopy gradient in Ci has been associated with enhanced rates of carbon assimilation at high light, and concomitant greater draw-downs in Ci. However, increases in irradiance in the canopy are generally also associated with decreases in leaf water availability. Thus, stress effects on photosynthesis rates (A) and stomatal conductance (G), may provide a further explanation for the observed Ci gradients. To test the hypotheses of the sources of canopy variation in Ci, and quantitatively assess the influence of within-canopy differences in stomatal regulation on A, the seasonal and diurnal variation in G was studied in relation to seasonal average daily integrated quantum flux density (Qint) in tall shade-intolerant Populus tremula L. trees. Daily time-courses of A were simulated using the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. (Planta 149, 78–90, 1980). Stable carbon isotope composition of a leaf carbon fraction with rapid turnover rate was used to estimate canopy gradient in Ci during the simulations. Daily maximum G (Gmax) consistently increased with increasing Qint. However, canopy differences in Gmax decreased as soil water availability became limiting during the season. In water-stressed leaves, there were strong mid-day decreases in G that were poorly associated with vapour pressure deficits between the leaf and atmosphere, and the magnitude of the mid-day decreases in G occasionally interacted with long-term leaf light environment. Simulations indicated that the percentage of carbon lost due to mid-day stomatal closure was of the order of 5–10\%, and seasonal water stress increased this percentage up to 20\%. The percentage of carbon lost due to stomatal closure increased with increasing Qint. Canopy differences in light environment resulted in a gradient of daily average Ci of approximately 20 µmol mol−1. The canopy variation in seasonal and diurnal reductions in G led to a Ci gradient of approximately 100 µmol mol−1, and the actual canopy Ci gradient was of the same magnitude according to leaf carbon isotope composition. This study demonstrates that stress effects influence Ci more strongly than within-canopy light gradients, and also that leaves acclimated to different irradiance and water stress conditions may regulate water use largely independent of foliar photosynthetic potentials.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the interaction of growth irradiance (Qint) with leaf capacity for and kinetics of adjustment of the pool size of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (sum of violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin; VAZ) and photosynthetic electron transport rate (Jmax) after changes in leaf light environment. Individual leaves of lower-canopy/lower photosynthetic capacity species Tilia cordata Mill. and upper canopy/higher photosynthetic capacity species Populus tremula L. were either illuminated by additional light of 500–800 µmol m−2 s−1 for 12 h photoperiod or enclosed in shade bags. The extra irradiance increased the total amount of light intercepted by two-fold for the upper and 10–15-fold for the lower canopy leaves, whereas the shade bags transmitted 45\% of incident irradiance. In control leaves, VAZ/area, VAZ/Chl and Jmax were positively associated with leaf growth irradiance (Qint). After 11 d extra illumination, VAZ/Chl increased in all cases due to a strong reduction in foliar chlorophyll, but VAZ/area increased in the upper canopy leaves of both species, and remained constant or decreased in the lower canopy leaves of T. cordata. The slope for VAZ/area changes with cumulative extra irradiance was positively associated with Qint only in T. cordata, but not in P. tremula. Nevertheless, all leaves of P. tremula increased VAZ/area more than the most responsive leaves of T. cordata. Shading reduced VAZ content only in P. tremula, but not in T. cordata, again demonstrating that P. tremula is a more responsive species. Compatible with the hypothesis of the role of VAZ in photoprotection, the rates of photosynthetic electron transport declined less in P. tremula than in T. cordata after the extra irradiance treatment. However, foliar chlorophyll contents of the exposed leaves declined significantly more in the upper canopy of P. tremula, which is not consistent with the suggestion that the leaves with the highest VAZ content are more resistant to photoinhibition. This study demonstrates that previous leaf light environment may significantly affect the adaptation capacity of foliage to altered light environment, and also that species differences in photosynthetic capacity and acclimation potentials importantly alter this interaction.},

  abstract = {1 Successional replacement of intolerant species by shade tolerators along gap-understorey gradients is commonly associated with increasingly higher low-light carbon acquisition capacities of more tolerant species. This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny. 2 Light vs. MA relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower MA than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to MA increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR. 3 The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species’ successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological characteristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny.},

  abstract = {Within-canopy variation in leaf structural and photosynthetic characteristics is a major means by which whole canopy photosynthesis is maximized at given total canopy nitrogen. As key acclimatory modifications, leaf nitrogen content (NA) and photosynthetic capacity (AA) per unit area increase with increasing light availability in the canopy and these increases are associated with increases in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA) and/or nitrogen content per dry mass and/or allocation. However, leaf functional characteristics change with increasing leaf age during leaf development and aging, but the importance of these alterations for within-canopy trait gradients is unknown. I conducted a meta-analysis based on 71 canopies that were sampled at different time periods or, in evergreens, included measurements for different-aged leaves to understand how within-canopy variations in leaf traits (trait plasticity) depend on leaf age. The analysis demonstrated that in evergreen woody species, MA and NA plasticity decreased with increasing leaf age, but the change in AA plasticity was less suggesting a certain re-acclimation of AA to altered light. In deciduous woody species, MA and NA gradients in flush-type species increased during leaf development and were almost invariable through the rest of the season, while in continuously leaf-forming species, the trait gradients increased constantly with increasing leaf age. In forbs, NA plasticity increased, while in grasses, NA plasticity decreased with increasing leaf age, reflecting life form differences in age-dependent changes in light availability and in nitrogen resorption for growth of generative organs. Although more work is needed to improve the coverage of age-dependent plasticity changes in some plant life forms, I argue that the age-dependent variation in trait plasticity uncovered in this study is large enough to warrant incorporation in simulations of canopy photosynthesis through the growing period.},

  abstract = {1 A trade-off between the investments in functional and support structures is a major determinant of leaf physiological activities. A variety of leaf shapes and venation densities occur in coexisting vegetation, but the costs and benefits of various leaf shapes and venation architectures are poorly understood. As the lever arms (location of leaf mass centre) become effectively longer as the maximum of lamina mass distribution shifts farther from the lamina base, we hypothesized that the fraction of lamina biomass in the mid-rib (FMR) is larger in leaves in which the centroid of lamina mass is located at, or greater than, half-leaf length (‘elliptic’ leaves) compared with leaves having the centroid of lamina mass located closer to the leaf base (‘ovate’ leaves). We further hypothesized that minor vein density (ρV) is larger in leaves with lower FMR, compensating for lower investments in central support. Finally, we predicted that ρV is lower in parallel/palmate-veined than in pinnate-veined leaves, due to a more uniform distribution of large veins in parallel/palmate-veined leaves. 2 F MR and ρV were studied in 44 herbs and woody seedlings with an overall variation in lamina fresh mass (MFL) of more than five orders of magnitude, and a sixfold variation in leaf longevity. Species were separated between pinnate-veined elliptic and ovate leaves, and parallel- or palmate-veined elliptic and ovate leaves. 3 Contrary to the hypothesis, support investment in the mid-rib was similar among leaf shapes, and scaled positively with leaf size and negatively with leaf longevity. However, FMR and ρV were negatively associated. Fractional biomass investment in the mid-rib scaled with lamina size (fresh and dry mass and area), but at a common lamina size FMR was larger in pinnate-veined elliptic than in parallel/palmate-veined elliptic leaves. In addition, ρV was larger in pinnate than in parallel/palmate-veined leaves, and the differences in lamina carbon content further suggested an overall greater investment of lamina biomass in the minor veins of pinnate-veined leaves. 4 These data demonstrate that the effect of leaf shape on biomass investments in central support is less significant than predicted by biomechanical models, partly because of the trade-off between the biomass investments in central support and minor veins, which compensate for differences in lamina shape. These data collectively indicate that leaf size, longevity, shape and venation pattern can importantly modify the distribution of foliage biomass between support and functional tissues, and thus can alter foliage physiological activity and leaf functioning in environments with different resource availability.},

  abstract = {A process-based leaf gas exchange model for C3 plants was developed which specifically describes the effects observed along light gradients of shifting nitrogen investment in carboxylation and bioenergetics and modified leaf thickness due to altered stacking of photosynthetic units. The model was parametrized for the late-successional, shade-tolerant deciduous species Acer saccharum Marsh. The specific activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) and the maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate per unit cytochrome f (cyt f) were used as indices that vary proportionally with nitrogen investment in the capacities for carboxylation and electron transport. Rubisco and cyt f per unit leaf area are related in the model to leaf dry mass per area (MA), leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf dry mass (Nm), and partitioning coefficients for leaf nitrogen in Rubisco (PR) and in bioenergetics (PB). These partitioning coefficients are estimated from characteristic response curves of photosynthesis along with information on lear structure and composition. While PR and PB determine the light-saturated value of photosynthesis, the fraction of leaf nitrogen in thylakoid light-harvesting components (PL) and the ratio of leaf chlorophyll to leaf nitrogen invested in light harvesting (CB), which is dependent on thylakoid stoichiometry, determine the initial photosynthetic light utilization efficiency in the model. Carbon loss due to mitochondrial respiration, which also changes along light gradients, was considered to vary in proportion with carboxylation capacity. Key model parameters - Nm, PR, PB, PLCB and stomatal sensitivity with respect to changes in net photosynthesis (Gr) – were examined as a function of MA, which is linearly related to irradiance during growth of the leaves. The results of the analysis applied to A. saccharum indicate that PB and PR increase, and Gf, PL and CB decrease with increasing MA. As a result of these effects of irradiaiice on nitrogen partitioning, the slope of the light-saturated net photosynthesis rate per unit leaf dry mass (Ammax) versus Nm relationship increased with increasing growth irradiance in mid-season. Furthermore, the nitrogen partitioning coefficients as well as the slopes of Ammax versus Nm were independent of season, except during development of the leaf photosynthetic apparatus. Simulations revealed that the acclimation to high light increased Ammax by 40\% with respect to the low light regime. However, light-saturated photosynthesis per leaf area (Aamax) varied 3-fold between these habitats, suggesting that the acclimation to high light was dominated by adjustments in leaf anatomy (Aamax=AmmaxMA) rather than in foliar biochemistry. This differed from adaptation to low light, where the alterations in foliar biochemistry were predicted to be at least as important as anatomical modifications. Due to the light-related accumulation of photosynthetic mass per unit area, Aamax depended on MA and leaf nitrogen per unit area (Na). However, Na conceals the variation in both MA and Nm (Na=NmMA), and prevents clear separation of anatomical adjustments in foliage structure and biochemical modifications in foliar composition. Given the large seasonal and site nutrient availability-related variation in Nm, and the influences of growth irradiance on nitrogen partitioning, the relationship between Aamax and Na is universal neither in time nor in space and in natural canopies at mid-season is mostly driven by variability in MA. Thus, we conclude that analyses of the effects of nitrogen investments on potential carbon acquisition should use mass-based rather than area-based expressions.},

  abstract = {Plant canopies are characterized by extensive and interacting gradients in light, temperature, humidity and wind. As every leaf in the canopy is exposed to unique combinations of environmental variables and has distinctive suite of structural and physiological traits, modeling canopy photosynthesis is a challenging endeavor. Due to the highly non-linear response of photosynthesis to light, temperature and humidity, whole canopy photosynthesis cannot be derived from the average values of light and temperature, but complex models simulating both temporal and spatial variability in environmental drivers and photosynthetic potentials are needed to estimate canopy photosynthesis. Two fundamentally different classes of canopy models have been developed. Predictive integration algorithms that describe the actual spatial distribution of foliage elements and photosynthetic capacity have the objective to simulate whole-stand carbon uptake and other canopy processes as closely as possible. Recent advances in these models have led to complex three-dimensional (3D) models that are capable of simulating radiation interception in discontinuous canopies considering complex radiative transfer phenomena such as penumbra and light scattering. A large number of parameters needed is the disadvantage of these explicit integration algorithms. Alternatively, optimization models predict total canopy leaf area and foliage photosynthetic potentials from the assumption of maximization of canopy photosynthesis by the optimal use of available nitrogen or foliage biomass. Significantly smaller number of parameters is needed for these models as the spatial distributions of foliage and photosynthetic characteristics are determined by assumptions about optimality. However, the simple optimization models considering only light as the key environmental factor and assuming that plant canopy consists of identical individual non-competing plants result in a significant bias between simulated and measured photosynthesis profiles within the canopy, limiting the use of such models in practical scaling applications. Recently developed models considering competition between different individuals have yielded better correspondence between the data and predictions, suggesting that optimization models have a large potential for predictive purposes. More information of the functioning of plant canopies, in particular of the response of plants to multiple environmental stresses in the canopies as well as competitive interactions is still needed to define “right” optimization functions and to correctly simulate photosynthetic productivity in highly heterogeneous canopy environment.},

This review summarizes current knowledge of potentials and limitations of acclimation of foliage photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and light-harvesting efficiency to complex environmental gradients within the canopies. Acclimation of Amax to high light availability involves accumulation of rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins per unit leaf area as the result of increases in leaf thickness in broad-leaved species and volume : total area ratio and mesophyll thickness in species with complex geometry of leaf cross-section. Enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency in low light occurs through increased chlorophyll production per unit dry mass, greater leaf area per unit dry mass investment in leaves and shoot architectural modifications that improve leaf exposure and reduce within-shoot shading. All these acclimation responses vary among species, resulting in species-specific use efficiencies of low and high light. In fast-growing canopies and in evergreen species, where foliage developed and acclimated to a certain light environment becomes shaded by newly developing foliage, leaf senescence, age-dependent changes in cell wall characteristics and limited foliage re-acclimation capacity can constrain adjustment of older leaves to modified light availabilities. The review further demonstrates that leaves in different canopy positions respond differently to dynamic fluctuations in light availability and to multiple environmental stresses. Foliage acclimated to high irradiance respond more plastically to rapid changes in leaf light environment, and is more resistant to co-occurring heat and water stress. However, in higher light, co-occurring stresses can more strongly curb the efficiency of foliage photosynthetic machinery through reductions in internal diffusion conductance to CO2. This review demonstrates strong foliage potential for acclimation to within-canopy environmental gradients, but also highlights complex constraints on acclimation and foliage functioning resulting from light × foliage age interactions, multiple environmental stresses, dynamic light fluctuations and species-specific leaf and shoot structural constraints.},

  abstract = {Abstract: There is a strong natural light gradient from the top to the bottom in plant canopies and along gap-understorey continua. Leaf structure and photosynthetic capacities change close to proportionally along these gradients, leading to maximisation of whole canopy photosynthesis. However, other environmental factors also vary within the light gradients in a correlative manner. Specifically, the leaves exposed to higher irradiance suffer from more severe heat, water, and photoinhibition stresses. Research in tree canopies and across gap-understorey gradients demonstrates that plants have a large potential to acclimate to interacting environmental limitations. The optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport increases with increasing growth irradiance in the canopy, improving the resistance of photosynthetic apparatus to heat stress. Stomatal constraints on photosynthesis are also larger at higher irradiance because the leaves at greater evaporative demands regulate water use more efficiently. Furthermore, upper canopy leaves are more rigid and have lower leaf osmotic potentials to improve water extraction from drying soil. The current review highlights that such an array of complex interactions significantly modifies the potential and realized whole canopy photosynthetic productivity, but also that the interactive effects cannot be simply predicted as composites of additive partial environmental stresses. We hypothesize that plant photosynthetic capacities deviate from the theoretical optimum values because of the interacting stresses in plant canopies and evolutionary trade-offs between leaf- and canopy-level plastic adjustments in light capture and use.},

  abstract = {Forest trees are exposed to a myriad of single and combined stresses with varying strength and duration throughout their lifetime, and many of the simultaneous and successive stress factors strongly interact. While much progress has been achieved in understanding the effects of single stresses on tree performance, multiple interacting stress effects cannot be adequately assessed from combination of single factor analyses. In particular, global change brings about novel combinations of severity and timing of different stresses, the effects of which on tree performance are currently hard to predict. Furthermore, the combinations of stresses commonly sustained by trees change during tree ontogeny. In addition, tree photosynthesis and growth rates decline with increasing tree age and size, while support biomass in roots, stem and branches accumulates and the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates increase, collectively resulting in an enhancement of non-structural carbon pools. In this review, tree physiological responses to key environmental stress factors and their combinations are analyzed from seedlings to mature trees. The key conclusions of this analysis are that combined stresses can influence survival of large trees even more than chronic exposure to a single predictable stress such as drought. In addition, tree tolerance to many environmental stresses increases throughout the ontogeny as the result of accumulation of non-structural carbon pools, implying major change in sensing, response and acclimation to single and multiple stresses in trees of different size and age.},

  abstract = {Lack of information on ecological characteristics of species across different continents hinders development of general world-scale quantitative vegetation dynamic models. We constructed common scales of shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerance for 806 North American, European/West Asian, and East Asian temperate shrubs and trees representing about 40\% of the extant natural Northern Hemisphere species pool. These scales were used to test the hypotheses that shade tolerance is negatively related to drought and waterlogging tolerances, and that these correlations vary among continents and plant functional types. We observed significant negative correlations among shade and drought tolerance rankings for all data pooled, and separately for every continent and plant functional type, except for evergreen angiosperms. Another significant trade-off was found for drought and waterlogging tolerance for all continents, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, but not for gymnosperms. For all data pooled, for Europe and East Asia, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, shade tolerance was also negatively associated with waterlogging tolerance. Quantile regressions revealed that the negative relationship between shade and drought tolerance was significant for species growing in deep to moderate shade and that the negative relationship between shade and waterlogging tolerance was significant for species growing in moderate shade to high light, explaining why all relationships between different tolerances were negative according to general regression analyses. Phylogenetic signal in the tolerance to any one of the three environmental factors studied was significant but low, with only 21–24\% of cladogram nodes exhibiting significant conservatism. The inverse relationships between different tolerances were significant in phylogenetically independent analyses both for the overall pool of species and for two multispecies genera (Pinus and Quercus) for which reliable molecular phylogenies were available. Only 2.6–10.3\% of the species were relatively tolerant to two environmental stresses simultaneously (tolerance value ≥3), and only three species were tolerant to all three stresses, supporting the existence of functional trade-offs in adjusting to multiple environmental limitations. These trade-offs represent a constraint for niche differentiation, reducing the diversity of plant responses to the many combinations of irradiance and water supply that are found in natural ecosystems.},

Canopy differences in the rate of development of leaf photosynthetic capacity were mainly controlled by the rate of change in MA.

The decline in N contents led to similar decreases in leaf photosynthetic capacity and foliar chlorophyll contents.

Gas exchange and nutrient content data were collected from 144 observations of upper canopy leaves from at least 65 species at two forest sites in Panama, differing in species composition, rainfall and soil fertility. Photosynthetic parameters were derived from analysis of assimilation rate vs internal CO2 concentration curves (A/Ci), and relationships with foliar nitrogen (N) and P content were developed. The relationships between area-based photosynthetic parameters and nutrients were of similar strength for N and P and robust across diverse species and site conditions. The strongest relationship expressed maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) as a multivariate function of both N and P, and this relationship was improved with the inclusion of independent data on wood density. Models that estimate photosynthesis from foliar N would be improved only modestly by including additional data on foliar P, but doing so may increase the capability of models to predict future conditions in P-limited tropical forests, especially when combined with data on edaphic conditions and other environmental drivers.},

  abstract = {Tropical canopies are complex, with multiple canopy layers and pronounced gap dynamics contributing to their high species diversity and productivity. An important reason for this complexity is the large variation in shade tolerance among different tree species. At present, we lack a clear understanding of which plant traits control this variation, e.g., regarding the relative contributions of whole-plant versus leaf traits or structural versus physiological traits. We investigated a broad range of traits in six tropical montane rainforest tree species with different degrees of shade tolerance, grown under three different radiation regimes (under the open sky or beneath sparse or dense canopies). The two distinct shade-tolerant species had higher fractional biomass in leaves and branches while shade-intolerant species invested more into stems, and these differences were greater under low radiation. Leaf respiration and photosynthetic light compensation point did not vary with species shade tolerance, regardless of radiation regime. Leaf temperatures in open plots were markedly higher in shade-tolerant species due to their low transpiration rates and large leaf sizes. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in shade tolerance of tropical montane trees is controlled by species differences in whole-plant biomass allocation strategy rather than by difference in physiological leaf traits determining leaf carbon balance at low radiation.},

  abstract = {Understanding variation in leaf functional traits—including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus—is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (               LMA               ) within species but are roughly independent of               LMA               across the global flora.               LMA               is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (               LL               ). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most               LMA               variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most               LMA               variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (               i               ) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with               LMA               across species assemblages with low               LL               variance but should increase weakly with               LMA               across species assemblages with high               LL               variance and that (               ii               ) controlling for               LL               variation should increase the strength of the above               LMA               relationships. We present analyses of intra- and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to               LMA               variation in a given assemblage.},

  abstract = {The purpose of our study was to examine change in leaf structure (anatomy and morphology) through different phases of tree size and crown position within a Sri Lankan rain forest. We selected four late-successional canopy species that represented dominant genera (Shorea, Mesua) within an Asian tropical rain forest. All are considered shade-tolerant and capable of growing to maturity beneath closed-canopy late-successional forests. Species within each genus were either restricted to seepages and bottom slopes (valley species) or to upper slopes and ridges (ridge species). The size classes represented (i) seedlings, (ii) saplings, (iii) poles growing beneath closed-canopy conditions, and (iv) trees of the rain forest canopy. Between size classes, leaves were thicker and with higher stomatal densities for canopy trees than for seedling, sapling, and pole size classes. Plasticities for measures of leaf structure were greater for ridge species than valley species; except for cuticle thickness, which showed the opposite trend (valley {$>$} ridge). Area, length, and width of leaves attained maxima for the sapling size class for all species. Drip-tip lengths were greatest for seedlings of all species, and least for canopy trees. Trends in leaf structure and morphology dimensions across size classes for late-successional canopy tree species are the same as those trends reported between rain forest species of different habitat strata (e.g., understory shrubs versus upper canopy trees). Our results suggest leaf dimensions could provide robust measures of environment, irrespective of species, or size class of tree.},

  abstract = {We studied the interplay of atmospheric and canopy structure factors driving the canopy light environment (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density, PPFD) in primary moist tropical forest in the Tapajós National Forest, Brazil. We quantified the temporal and spatial length scales that characterize intact rain forest inhomogeneities, asking: Are seasonal changes in the canopy radiation balance evident at these scales? We sought to describe the components of intensity, duration and spatial variation of within-canopy PPFD in light of these inhomogeneities. Do fluctuating atmospheric conditions, especially the presence of clouds and precipitation, affect the radiative inputs at both the canopy top and the forest floor? We examined the characteristic scales of heterogeneity in the vertical and the horizontal using a two-part approach. For radiation we combined long-term continuous high-frequency measurements of down- and up-welling short-wave and visible wavebands above the canopy with similarly frequent observations from a dense sensor network at forest floor. Vertical variations in canopy structure, obtained with a ground-based LIDAR, similarly combined intensive observations at the sensor network with occasional large-scale transects along the forest floor. Close similarities in both radiation and canopy structure at both scales support the representativeness of local observations of the wider area. A composite broadband measure similar to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (denoted cbNDVI) was constructed from above-canopy observations to compare with reports of remotely sensed canopy reflectivity at this site. We estimated the canopy Leaf Area Index (LAI) by combining observations of the variation in understory transmittance by solar elevation with a commonly-used algorithm. We obtained the conventional whole-canopy extinction coefficient, by applying the Beer-Lambert law. Over the course of a year this forest receives 11,795\,mol m−2, only 62\% of potential clear-day PPFD – atmospheric transmissivity is reduced by clouds, precipitation, smoke and haze. Very little PAR (≈ 2\%) is reflected from the canopy and only 5.7\% penetrates to 1\,m above the forest floor - overall 92\% of PAR is absorbed by the canopy. All radiation balance components closely tracked the dynamics of incoming light, showing little seasonal variation. Understory light observations across the 7.5–28.5\,m spanning the understory array sensors showed essentially constant correlation between sensor pairs over time. There was a high degree of local persistence in the understory spatial pattern that varied slowly and directionally with the changing geometry of the sun and canopy structure. Over larger distances (to 1000\,m), the patterns of spatial autocorrelation of understory PPFD and outer canopy structure were remarkably similar in shape, both declining rapidly to a more-or-less constant level around 15–20\,m, a scale consistent with the dimensions of outer canopy crowns. The vertical pattern of transmission and absorption was estimated by combining understory transmittance with the distribution of canopy surface area obtained from the ground-based LIDAR system. It showed the maximum absorption relatively low in the canopy (8–19\,m above ground). Although rather tall (canopy height is at 41.5\,m), the extremely elaborate outer surface of the forest suggests the layers highest above ground are of little consequence to the PAR absorption budget. The cbNDVI measure exhibited seasonal variation consistent with other reports (somewhat higher in the wet season) but in contrast to a recent argument that the forest ‘greens up’ during the early dry season. However, except for the variations caused by the angle and intensity of incoming light modulated by atmospheric effects, there was little seasonality in the forest light environment at km67, including: canopy reflectances in several wavebands, all PPFD radiation budget components, the estimated LAI and mid-day PAR extinction coefficient and the length scales of understory PPFD. Canopy transmission was somewhat greater (6.4\%) under diffuse skies compared to the least diffuse conditions (6.0\%), and slightly more PPFD was absorbed under diffuse (92.7\%) versus the least diffuse conditions (92.3\%), but was not a significant contribution to the budget. The large diurnal variations in the extinction coefficient seriously affects its utility as a descriptor of canopy radiative properties. We propose an alternative approach for transmitted light: the canopy behaves as: 1.) a constant fraction filter under diffuse conditions, combined with 2.) a variable filter depending on solar elevation for sunfleck conditions. These regimes may be described with simple parameters each having mechanistic relations to canopy structure. In summary, we demonstrate that obtaining the radiation signal at forest floor at high data rate for long periods exploits seasonal sun angle changes to probe canopy structure. Combined with occasional long transect information, temporal and vertical sampling spatially allow improved definition of characteristic scales to describe both the understory light environment and canopy structure.},

  abstract = {We measured the vertical dynamics of leaf area in a tall, tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera)-dominated, deciduous forest on the Maryland coastal plain over three growing seasons (one intensively) using nondestructive, ground-based observations. Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were calculated by vertical level, time, and species; the time-integrated duration of leaf display (leaf area extent, LAE) was estimated by species and vertical level. In this stand LAI rises rapidly in the spring, declines slightly during the growing season, and then rapidly in the fall. In the intensively studied year, total LAI peaked at 7.1 m2m–2, LAE was 1259 m2m–2day, and the length of the canopy season (time from half-maximum LAI at leaf-out to the half-maximum at decline) was 191 days. The maximum growing season LAI, the date of leaf emergence, and the LAE differed among years, ranging 0.61 m2m–2, 14 days, and 261 m2m–2day, respectively. However, the timing of leaf fall was more consistent, ranging only 6 days. Each species differs in its height distribution, density, and timing of foliar display. In the canopy, leaf number, area, and duration are the bases of species importance; these differ substantially by species from typical importance values derived from stem-based attributes (density, basal area, biomass).

Andira legalis (Vell.) Toledo is a legume shrub widespread along the sandy plains of the Brazilian coast. It occurs both shaded, in forest habitats, or exposed to full sunlight, in the vegetation islands growing on sand deposits. Previous studies reported a high range of morpho-physiological variation for this species along a geographical gradient. This study compared leaf morphology and anatomy of A. legalis in two distinct but adjacent light environments: a dense forest (shaded) and a scrub of Palmae (exposed). We studied the amplitude of variation for these traits within a small (0.5 ha) geographical area. Leaf anatomy parameters were measured for five leaves collected from five plants in each habitat. The parameters measured were leaf and mesophyll thickness, thickness of the outer periclinal cell wall, thickness of the adaxial and abaxial epidermis and vascular bundle transversal section area, and also common epidermal cells, stomata and trichome density. Leaf morphology parameters were obtained from five leaves of each of 20 plants in each site. Dry and fresh weights were measured to obtain leaf specific mass and succulence. All anatomy and morphology parameters, except trichome density, were significantly higher for the sun-exposed plants. Less expected, however, was the marked qualitative difference between exposed and shaded plants: in the former the mesophyll had a unilateral symmetry (i.e., the whole mesophyll occupied by photosynthetic tissue), whereas in the latter there was a dorsiventral symmetry (i.e., partly palisade and partly spongy parenchyma). Such amplitude of variation shows that even within a small geographic area A. legalis has a broad ecological plasticity.},

Depending on the microsite, W. urens plants had smooth leaves with glandular trichomes or bristly leaves with both glandular trichomes and urticant trichomes (stinging hairs). Trichome density (number of urticant trichomes per unit leaf area) was higher in the dry season than in the wet season, and was significantly correlated with both temperature (r = 0.353, P {$<$} 0.05) and photosynthetic active radiation (r = 0.313, P {$<$} 0.05). Plants established in sun-exposed areas had trichome densities three times higher than those of plants established in shaded areas during the dry season, and 28 times higher during the wet season. At both exposed and shaded sites, trichome densities of the youngest leaves of young plants were higher than those of the youngest leaves of mature plants. In smooth and bristly leaves, transpiration rates decreased with increasing temperature during the day. However, smooth leaves had higher transpiration rates than bristly leaves at both exposed and shaded sites. In laboratory studies, trichome density was significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced when small sun-grown plants (0.20-0.30 m tall) were either shaded or irrigated. In larger plants, also, irrigation significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced trichome density relative to that of unirrigated controls.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic heat tolerances (PHTs) have several potential applications including predicting which species will be most vulnerable to climate change. Given that plants exhibit unique thermoregulatory traits that influence leaf temperatures and decouple them from ambient air temperatures, we hypothesized that PHTs should be correlated with extreme leaf temperatures as opposed to air temperatures. We measured leaf thermoregulatory traits, maximum leaf temperatures (TMO) and two metrics of PHT (Tcrit and T50) quantified using the quantum yield of photosystem II for 19 plant species growing in Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (Coral Gables, FL, USA). Thermoregulatory traits measured at the Garden and microenvironmental variables were used to parameterize a leaf energy balance model that estimated maximum in situ leaf temperatures (TMIS) across the geographic distributions of 13 species. TMO and TMIS were positively correlated with T50 but were not correlated with Tcrit. The breadth of species' thermal safety margins (the difference between T50 and TMO) was negatively correlated with T50. Our results provide observational and theoretical support based on a first principles approach for the hypothesis that PHTs may be adaptations to extreme leaf temperature, but refute the assumption that species with higher PHTs are less susceptible to thermal damage. Our study also introduces a novel method for studying plant ecophysiology by incorporating biophysical and species distribution models, and highlights how the use of air temperature versus leaf temperature can lead to conflicting conclusions about species vulnerability to thermal damage.

  abstract = {The heat tolerance of photosystem II (PSII) may promote carbon assimilation at higher temperatures and help explain plant responses to climate change. Higher PSII heat tolerance could lead to (a) increases in the high-temperature compensation point (Tmax); (b) increases in the thermal breadth of photosynthesis (i.e. the photosynthetic parameter Ω) to promote a thermal generalist strategy of carbon assimilation; (c) increases in the optimum rate of carbon assimilation Popt and faster carbon assimilation and/or (d) increases in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (Topt). To address these hypotheses, we tested if the Tcrit, T50 and T95 PSII heat tolerances were correlated with carbon assimilation parameters for 21 plant species. Our results did not support Hypothesis 1, but we observed that T50 may be used to estimate the upper thermal limit for Tmax at the species level, and that community mean Tcrit may be useful for approximating Tmax. The T50 and T95 heat tolerance metrics were positively correlated with Ω in support of Hypothesis 2. We found no support for Hypotheses 3 or 4. Our study shows that high PSII heat tolerance is unlikely to improve carbon assimilation at higher temperatures but may characterize thermal generalists with slow resource acquisition strategies.},

Despite which index is employed, increases in heatwave/warm spell intensity, frequency and duration are found. Furthermore, TX90pct and TN90pct trends are larger and exhibit more significance for warm spells, implying that non-summer events are driving annual trends over some regions. Larger increases in TN90pct aspects relative to EHF and TX90pct are also observed. While qualitative information on event trends is similar across the indices, quantitative values vary. This result highlights the importance of employing the most appropriate index when assessing the impact of sustained extreme temperature events.},

Part of this variation (c. 35\%) can be ascribed to differences between functional groups, with evergreen species having the highest LMA, but most of the variation is within groups or biomes. When grown in the same controlled environment, leaf succulents and woody evergreen, perennial or slow-growing species have inherently high LMA. Within most of the functional groups studied, high-LMA species show higher leaf tissue densities. However, differences between evergreen and deciduous species result from larger volumes per area (thickness). Response curves constructed from experiments under controlled conditions showed that LMA varied strongly with light, temperature and submergence, moderately with CO2 concentration and nutrient and water stress, and marginally under most other conditions. Functional groups differed in the plasticity of LMA to these gradients. The physiological regulation is still unclear, but the consequences of variation in LMA and the suite of traits interconnected with it are strong. This trait complex is an important factor determining the fitness of species in their environment and affects various ecosystem processes.},

Growth rate was highest at intermediate light levels (25-50\%) above which it declined. Most plant variables showed a curvilinear response to irradiance, with the largest changes at the lowest light levels. 4. There was a consistent ranking in growth between species; species that were fast growing in a low-light environment were also fast growing in a high-light environment. 5. At low light, interspecific variation in relative growth rate was determined mainly by differences in a morphological trait, the leaf area ratio (LAR), whereas at high light it was determined mainly by differences in a physiological trait, the net assimilation rate (NAR). 6. NAR became a stronger determinant of growth than LAR in more than 10-15\% daylight. As light availability in the forest is generally much lower than this threshold level, it follows that interspecific variation in growth in a forest environment is mainly owing to variation in morphology.},

The species tested represent a spectrum of regeneration patterns ranging from shade tolerant to light demanding. Overall, leaf optical properties of the four species were similar. Differences in absorptance were small, but statistically significant among the species and positions along the canopy gradient. Species absorptance differences corresponded somewhat to shade tolerance; two of the shade species showed higher absorptance in lower light environments, while the sun species showed the reverse pattern. Specific leaf mass (leaf weight per unit area) and chlorophyll content per unit leaf weight also changed along the canopy gradient. Specific leaf mass was positively correlated and chlorophyll per unit leaf weight was negatively correlated with increasing light environment. Consequently, the efficiency of absorption, as represented by the absorptance per unit leaf weight, increased as light level decreased, largely due to changes in specific leaf mass. In contrast, efficiency of absorption per unit leaf chlorophyll was relatively constant with light environment for the two species measured for chlorophyll.},

A large database including 500 experiments with 760 plant species enabled us to determine generalized dose-response curves. Many traits increase with DLI in a saturating fashion. Some showed a more than 10-fold increase over the DLI range of 1-50~mol~m-2 ~d-1 , such as the number of seeds produced per plant and the actual rate of photosynthesis. Strong decreases with DLI (up to three-fold) were observed for leaf area ratio and leaf payback time. Plasticity differences among species groups were generally small compared with the overall responses to DLI. However, for a number of traits, including photosynthetic capacity and realized growth, we found woody and shade-tolerant species to have lower plasticity. We further conclude that the direction and degree of trait changes adheres with responses to plant density and to vertical light gradients within plant canopies. This synthesis provides a strong quantitative basis for understanding plant acclimation to light, from molecular to whole plant responses, but also identifies the variables that currently form weak spots in our knowledge, such as respiration and reproductive characteristics.},

Species representative of contrasting shade tolerance groups were identified across a light gradient in the understorey of a Venezuelan Andean cloud forest. Measured traits included gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and morphoanatomical, biochemical and optical properties. Saplings were grown for 6 months in a shade-house receiving 20\% photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) of full sunlight. Plant samples were then moved to shade-houses receiving low PPF (4\%) or high PPF (65\%). A factorial model (species × PPF), with repeated measurements (0, 15 and 120 days) was designed. Our results showed that morphological and anatomical traits were more plastic to PPF changes than photosynthetic traits. All species were susceptible to photoinhibition (15 days): shade-intolerant species showed dynamic photoinhibition (120 days), whereas shade-tolerant species presented chronic photoinhibition and the consequent inability to increase C assimilation rates under high PPF. The partially shade-tolerant species showed mixed responses; nonetheless, they exhibited larger adjustments in morphoanatomical and optical properties. Thus the acclimation responses of these species when subject to contrasting light conditions could help to explain their distribution along the light gradient in the understorey.},

A. sinuate (sun) and R. spectabilis (partial shade) had higher photosynthetic capacities (maximum apparent photosynthetic electron transport rates, ETRmax) and higher light saturation intensities (Ik) than V. alaskaense (partial shade) and V. ovalifolium (shade). A. sinuate was less sensitive to photoprotective down regulation through the xanthophyll cycle (qE) than R. spectabilis. Vaccinium species showed similar photosynthetic characteristics except V. ovalifolium was sensitive qE while V. alaskaense was not. A comparison of A. sinuate trees growing in the ‘sun’ versus ‘shade’ revealed sun trees had higher ETRmax and Ik than shade trees. High photochemical quenching (qP; 0.893–0.978), associated with photochemical productivity, measured along with low non-photochemical quenching (qN; 0.252–0.678) at Ik revealed shade plants are acclimated to low ambient light, and have limited use for qN. Nonetheless, at higher light intensities, all species are ready to safely dissipate excess light in non-photochemical quenching to heat based on qN (\textasciitilde 0.6–0.8) and NPQ (\textasciitilde 0.7–2.6). These findings illustrate the adaptive responses of plants growing at high latitudes with respect to photoacclimation. Differences between plants were correlated to their position along the natural light gradient created by the forest canopy.},

However, in mechanically thinned stands there is little information on the effects of different patterns and densities of live-tree retention on forest canopy microclimate. This study compared gradients of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) through the vertical forest profile among an overstory-thin, an understory-thin, an un-thinned control, and a riparian environment in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Temperature and humidity were recorded for a year by 60 data loggers arrayed in 12 trees at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 m above the forest floor. Both thinning treatments had significantly more extreme summer daily ranges of temperature and VPD than the control across heights. The overstory-thin resulted in the greatest maximum temperatures, VPDs, and VPD range among all sensors at 5 m, and significantly higher summer maximum temperatures and VPDs than the control in lower strata ( 15 m). The understory-thin also had significantly higher summer maximum temperatures than the control ( 15 m), but these too were significantly less than in the overstory-thin nearest the surface at 5 m. Understory thinning did not alter the mean or range of microclimate as much as overstory thinning. Riparian microclimate had significantly lower minimums and means, and greater daily ranges of temperatures and VPDs than the control. Results suggest that thinning canopy cover significantly increases the extremes and variability of understory microclimate compared to thinning from below and no-thin treatments.},

  abstract = {Understanding leaf temperature (Tleaf) variation in the canopy of tropical forests is critical for accurately calculating net primary productivity because plant respiration and net photosynthesis are highly sensitive to temperature. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of Tleaf in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict Tleaf in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20−35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. Tleaf was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that Tleaf is best explained by air temperature (Tair) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, Tair alone predicted most of the variation in Tleaf. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate Tleaf variability where simple meteorological data are available. This approach can be incorporated in future models of vegetation−atmosphere carbon and water exchange models of mature tropical forests with similar seasonality.},

  abstract = {The timing of phenological events varies both among species, and also among individuals of the same species. Here we use a 12-year record of spring and autumn phenology for 33 woody species at the Harvard Forest to investigate these differences. Specifically, we focus on patterns of leaf budburst, expansion, coloration and fall, in the context of differences between canopy and understory species, and between canopy and understory individuals of the same species. Many understory species appear to adopt a strategy of “phenological escape” in spring but not autumn, taking advantage of the high-light period in spring before canopy development. For all but a few of these species, the spring escape period is very brief. Relationships between canopy and understory conspecifics (i.e. individuals of the same species) varied among species, with leaf budburst and leaf fall occurring earlier in understory individuals of some species, but later in other species. We fit standard models of varying complexity to the budburst time series for each species to investigate whether biological responses to environmental cues differed among species. While there was no clear consensus model, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that a simple two-parameter “Spring warming” model was best supported by the data for more than a third of all species, and well supported for two-thirds of all species. More highly-parameterized models involving various chilling requirements (e.g., Alternating, Parallel or Sequential chilling) were less well supported by the data. Species-specific model parameterization suggested that responses to both chilling and forcing temperatures vary among species. While there were no obvious differences in this regard between canopy and understory species, or between early- and late-budburst species, these results imply that species can be expected to differ in their responses to future climate change.},

  abstract = {1. Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography. 2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because Amax/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and Amax/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in Amax/area, particularly in small saplings. 3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species. 4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. Amax/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. Amax/mass, PNUEmax and Amax/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.},

However, analyses of climatic effects on tree growth have primarily focused on the upper canopy, leaving understory dynamics unresolved. We analyzed differences in climate sensitivity based on canopy position of four common tree species (Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) using growth information from 1084 trees across eight sites in the northeastern United States. Effects of canopy position on climate response varied, but were significant and often non-linear, for all four species. Compared to overstory trees, understory trees showed stronger reductions in growth at high temperatures and varied shifts in precipitation response. This contradicts the prevailing assumption that climate responses, particularly to temperature, of understory trees are buffered by the overstory. Forest growth trajectories are uncertain in compositionally and structurally complex forests, and future demography and regeneration dynamics may be misinferred if not all canopy levels are represented in future forecasts.},

The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of weather conditions on the magnitude of shade avoidance responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. We first generated a growth rate database under controlled conditions and elaborated a model that predicts daytime hypocotyl growth as a function of the activity of the main photosensory receptors (phytochromes A and B, cryptochromes 1 and 2) in combination with light and temperature inputs. We then incorporated the action of thermal amplitude to account for its effect on selected genotypes, which correlates with the dynamics of the growth-promoting transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4. The model predicted growth rate in the field with reasonable accuracy. Thus, we used the model in combination with a worldwide data set of current and future whether conditions. The analysis predicted enhanced shade avoidance responses as a result of higher temperatures due to the geographical location or global warming. Irradiance and thermal amplitude had no effects. These trends were also observed for our local growth rate measurements. We conclude that, if water and nutrients do not become limiting, warm environments enhance the shade avoidance response.},

Some potential confounding factors have not been investigated with large data sets, limiting our understanding of the adaptive significance of leaf teeth and their reliability to reconstruct paleoclimate. Here we test the strength of correlations between leaf-margin state and deciduousness, leaf thickness, wood type (ring-porous vs. diffuse-porous), height within community, and several leaf economic variables. • Methods: We assembled a trait database for 3549 species from six continents based on published and original data. The strength of associations between traits was quantified using correlational and principal axes approaches. • Key results: Toothed species, independent of temperature, are more likely to be deciduous and to have thin leaves, a high leaf nitrogen concentration, a low leaf mass per area, and ring-porous wood. Canopy trees display the highest sensitivity between leaf-margin state and temperature; subcanopy plants, especially herbs, are less sensitive. • Conclusions: Our data support hypotheses linking the adaptive significance of teeth to leaf thickness and deciduousness (in addition to temperature). Toothed species associate with the “fast-return” end of the leaf economic spectrum, providing another functional link to thin leaves and the deciduous habit. Accounting for these confounding factors should improve climate estimates from tooth-based methods.},

  abstract = {Intracanopy plasticity in tree leaf form is a major determinant of whole-plant function and potentially of forest understory ecology. However, there exists little systematic information for the full extent of intracanopy plasticity, whether it is linked with height and exposure, or its variation across species. For arboretum-grown trees of six temperate deciduous species averaging 13–18 m in height, we quantified intracanopy plasticity for 11 leaf traits across three canopy locations (basal-interior, basal-exterior, and top). Plasticity was pronounced across the canopy, and maximum likelihood analyses indicated that plasticity was primarily linked with irradiance, regardless of height. Intracanopy plasticity (the quotient of values for top and basal-interior leaves) was often similar across species and statistically indistinguishable across species for several key traits. At canopy tops, the area of individual leaves was on average 0.5–0.6 times that at basal-interior, stomatal density 1.1–1.5 times higher, sapwood cross-sectional area up to 1.7 times higher, and leaf mass per area 1.5–2.2 times higher; guard cell and stomatal pore lengths were invariant across the canopy. Species differed in intracanopy plasticity for the mass of individual leaves, leaf margin dissection, ratio of leaf to sapwood areas, and stomatal pore area per leaf area; plasticity quotients ranged only up to ≈2. Across the six species, trait plasticities were uncorrelated and independent of the magnitude of the canopy gradient in irradiance or height and of the species' light requirements for regeneration. This convergence across species indicates general optimization or constraints in development, resulting in a bounded plasticity that improves canopy performance.},

Klamina was measured for sun and shade leaves of six woody temperate species growing in moist soil, and tested for correlation with the prevailing leaf irradiance, and with 22 other leaf traits. Klamina varied from 7.40 × 10−5 kg m−2 s−1 MPa−1 for Acer saccharum shade leaves to 2.89 × 10−4 kg m−2 s−1 MPa−1 for Vitis labrusca sun leaves. Tree sun leaves had 15–67\% higher Klamina than shade leaves. Klamina was co-ordinated with traits associated with high water flux, including leaf irradiance, petiole hydraulic conductance, guard cell length, and stomatal pore area per lamina area. Klamina was also co-ordinated with lamina thickness, water storage capacitance, 1/mesophyll water transfer resistance, and, in five of the six species, with lamina perimeter/area. However, for the six species, Klamina was independent of inter-related leaf traits including leaf dry mass per area, density, modulus of elasticity, osmotic potential, and cuticular conductance. Klamina was thus co-ordinated with structural and functional traits relating to liquid-phase water transport and to maximum rates of gas exchange, but independent of other traits relating to drought tolerance and to aspects of carbon economy.},

Sun leaves of both tree species possessed higher levels in chlorophylls (Chl) and carotenoids on a leaf area basis, higher values for the ratio Chl a/b and lower values for the ratio Chl/carotenoids (a+b)/(x+c) in comparison to shade leaves. The higher photosynthetic rates P(N) of sun leaves (ginkgo 5.4+/-0.9 and beech 8.5+/-2.1 micromol m(-2)s(-1)) were also reflected by higher values for the Chl fluorescence decrease ratios R(F)(d) 690 and R(F)(d) 735. In contrast, the shade leaves had lower P(N) rates (ginkgo 2.4+/-0.3 and beech 1.8+/-1.2 micromol m(-2)s(-1)). In both tree species the stomatal conductance G(s) was significantly higher in sun (range: 70-19 1 mmol m(-2)s(-1)) as compared to shade leaves (range: 5-55 mmol m(-2)s(-1)). In fact, at saturating light conditions there existed a close correlation between G(s) values and P(N) rates. Differences between sun and shade leaves also existed in several other Chl fluorescence ratios (F(v)/F(m), F(v)/F(o), and the stress adaptation index Ap). The results clearly demonstrate that the fan-shaped gymnosperm ginkgo leaves show the same high and low irradiance adaptation response as the angiosperm beech leaves.}

  abstract = {We observed that the upper thermal limits of leaf function in 12 tree species from a seasonally dry tropical forest were perilously close to maximum temperatures in this region. Exposure to drought increased thermotolerance, and species that were more drought tolerant were also more thermotolerant. Importantly, thermotolerance was positively related to the key leaf functional trait - leaf mass per area, and negatively related to photosynthetic rates. These results indicate that tropical trees will be vulnerable to increased warming, and more productive species with lower LMA and higher photosynthetic rates may be more negatively affected by global warming and future climate change., Understanding how tropical trees will respond to extreme temperatures and drought is essential to predict how future increases in the severity, frequency and duration of extreme climatic events will affect tropical systems. In this study, we investigated leaf thermotolerance by quantifying the temperatures that resulted in a 50 \% decrease in photosystem II function (T50) in experimentally grown saplings of 12 tree species from a seasonally dry tropical forest. We examined the relationship of thermotolerance with leaf functional traits and photosynthetic rates. Additionally, we tested how water limitation altered thermotolerance within species, and examined the relationship between thermotolerance and drought tolerance among species. Thermotolerance ranged from 44.5 to 48.1 °C in the least and most thermotolerant species, respectively. The observed variation in thermotolerance indicates that the upper limits of leaf function are critically close to maximum temperatures in this region, and that these species will be vulnerable to, and differentially affected by, future warming. Drought increased temperature tolerance, and species that were more drought tolerant were also more thermotolerant. Importantly, thermotolerance was positively related to the key leaf functional trait—leaf mass per area (LMA), and congruent with this, negatively related to photosynthetic rates. These results indicate that more productive species with lower LMA and higher photosynthetic rates may be more vulnerable to heat and drought stress, and more likely to be negatively affected by future increases in extreme climatic events.},

  abstract = {Extreme weather events, such as unusually hot or dry conditions, can cause death by exceeding physiological limits, and so cause loss of population. Survival will depend on whether or not susceptible organisms can find refuges that buffer extreme conditions. Microhabitats offer different microclimates to those found within the wider ecosystem, but do these microhabitats effectively buffer extreme climate events relative to the physiological requirements of the animals that frequent them? We collected temperature data from four common microhabitats (soil, tree holes, epiphytes and vegetation) located from the ground to canopy in primary rainforests in the Philippines. Ambient temperatures were monitored from outside of each microhabitat and from the upper forest canopy, which represent our macrohabitat controls. We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTmax ) of frog and lizard species, which are thermally sensitive and inhabit our microhabitats. Microhabitats reduced mean temperature by 1-2°C and reduced the duration of extreme temperature exposure by 14 to 31 times. Microhabitat temperatures were below the CTmax of inhabitant frogs and lizards, whereas macrohabitats consistently contained lethal temperatures. Microhabitat temperatures increased by 0.11 to 0.66°C for every 1°C increase in macrohabitat temperature, and this non-uniformity in temperature change influenced our forecasts of vulnerability for animal communities under climate change. Assuming uniform increases of 6°C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 32-fold, whereas under non-uniform increases of 0.66 to 3.96°C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 108-fold. Microhabitats have extraordinary potential to buffer climate and likely reduce mortality during extreme climate events. These results suggest that predicted changes in distribution due to mortality and habitat shifts that are derived from macroclimatic samples and that assume uniform changes in microclimates relative to macroclimates may be overly pessimistic. Nevertheless, even non-uniform temperature increases within buffered microhabitats would still threaten frogs and lizards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.}

It discusses implications of findings for leaf morphology as it affects - and is affected by - the local microclimate. Predictions of transfer from many leaves in plant communities are complicated by physical and physiological feedback mechanisms between leaves and their environment. Some common approaches, and the current challenge of integrating leaf-atmosphere interactions into models of global relevance, are also briefly addressed.},

  abstract = {Leaves within a canopy may experience rapid and extreme fluctuations in ambient conditions. A shaded leaf, for example, may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds, due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments, (2 to 60 minutes), the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations, the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid over-heating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought. Our results also suggest that typical leaf water contents could sustain several minutes of evaporative cooling during a sunfleck without increasing the xylem water supply and thus risking embolism. We thus submit that shaded leaves rely on hydraulic capacitance and evaporative cooling to avoid over-heating and hydraulic failure during exposure to typical sunflecks, whereas thermal capacitance provides limited protection for very short sunflecks (tens of seconds).},

Ehrh. and shade-intolerant Prunus serotina, a J.F. Ehrh. and Betula papyrifera Marsh. Seedlings were exposed to a factorial combination of [CO2] (ambient and elevated (658 µmol mol –1)) and understory shade (deep and moderate) in open-top chambers placed in a forest understory. The elevated [CO2] treatment increased mean light-saturated net photosynthetic rate by 63\% in the shade-tolerant species and 67\% in the shade-intolerant species. However, when measured at the elevated [CO2], long-term enhancement of photosynthesis was 10\% lower than the instantaneous enhancement seen in ambient-[CO2]-grown plants (P {$<$} 0.021). Overall, growth light environment affected long-term photosynthetic enhancement by elevated [CO2]: as the growth irradiance increased, proportional enhancement due to elevated [CO2] decreased from 97\% for plants grown in deep shade to 47\% for plants grown in moderate shade. Results suggest that in N-limited northern temperate forests, trees grown in deep shade may display greater photosynthetic gains from a CO2-enriched atmosphere than trees growing in more moderate shade, because of greater downregulation in the latter environment. If photosynthetic gains by deep-shade-grown plants in response to elevated [CO2] translate into improved growth and survival of shade-intolerant species, it could alter the future composition and dynamics of successional forest communities.},

Between 1986 and 2016, 17\% of Europe’s forest area was disturbed by anthropogenic and/or natural causes. We identified 36 million individual disturbance patches with a mean patch size of 1.09 ha, which equals an annual average of 0.52 disturbance patches per km2 of forest area. The majority of disturbances were stand replacing. While trends in disturbance size were highly variable, disturbance frequency consistently increased and disturbance severity decreased. Here we present a continental-scale characterization of Europe’s forest disturbance regimes and their changes over time, providing spatial information that is critical for understanding the ongoing changes in Europe’s forests.},

  abstract = {Plants emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) causing transcriptomic, metabolomic and behavioral responses in receiver organisms. Volatiles involved in such responses are often called “plant language”. Arthropods having sensitive chemoreceptors can recognize language released by plants. Insect herbivores, pollinators and natural enemies respond to composition of volatiles from plants with specialized receptors responding to different types of compounds. In contrast, the mechanism of how plants “hear” volatiles has remained obscured. In a plant-plant communication, several individually emitted compounds are known to prime defense response in receiver plants with a specific manner according to the chemical structure of each volatile compound. Further, composition and ratio of volatile compounds in the plant-released plume is important in plant-insect and plant-plant interactions mediated by plant volatiles. Studies on volatile-mediated plant-plant signaling indicate that the signaling distances are rather short, usually not longer than one meter. Volatile communication from plants to insects such as pollinators could be across distances of hundreds of meters. As many of the herbivore induced VOCs have rather short atmospheric life times, we suggest that in long-distant communications with plant volatiles, reaction products in the original emitted compounds may have additional information value of the distance to emission source together with the original plant-emitted compounds.},

  abstract = {It is well known that vertical canopy gradients and varying sky conditions influence photosynthesis (Pn), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf thickness (LT) and leaf pigments (lutein, â-carotene and chlorophyll). In contrast, little is known about these effects on monoterpenoid (MT) emissions. Our study examines simultaneously measured Pn, MT emissions and the MT/Pn ratio along the canopy of an adult European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica L.) in natural forest conditions. Dynamic branch enclosure systems were used at four heights in the canopy (7, 14, 21 and 25~m) in order to establish relationships and better understand the interaction between Pn and MT emissions under both sunny and cloudy sky conditions. Clear differences in Pn, MT emissions and the MT/Pn ratio were detected within the canopy. The highest Pn rates were observed in the sun leaves at 25~m due to the higher intercepted light levels, whereas MT emissions (and the MT/Pn ratio) were unexpectedly highest in the semi-shaded leaves at 21~m. The higher Pn rates and, apparently contradictory, lower MT emissions in the sun leaves may be explained by the hypothesis of Owen and Peñuelas (2005), stating synthesis of more photo-protective carotenoids may decrease the emissions of volatile isoprenoids (including MTs) because they both share the same biochemical precursors. In addition, leaf traits like SLA, LT and leaf pigments clearly differed with height in the canopy, suggesting that the leaf's physiological status cannot be neglected in future research on biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) when aiming at developing new and/or improved emission algorithms.},

  abstract = {The response of tropical trees to rising temperatures represents a key uncertainty that limits our ability to predict biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks in a warming world. We review the current understanding of temperature effects on the ecophysiology of tropical trees from organelle to biome level, where we distinguish between short-term responses, acclimation, and adaptation. We present new data on short-term temperature responses of photosynthesis and dark respiration, and temperature acclimation of photosynthesis. We also compare new field and laboratory-obtained photosynthesis-temperature response data. We identify several priority study areas. (1) Acclimation: We need to better understand photosynthetic acclimation, for example to determine whether the adjustment of the thermal optimum of photosynthesis (TOpt) is consistently negated by a decrease in photosynthesis at TOpt, as we observed. (2) Growth: Whereas tropical seedlings may grow better with warming, canopy trees reportedly grow worse; we do not currently know what explains these contrasting temperature effects. (3) Reproduction: Tropical trees may be close to reproductive temperature thresholds, as heat sterility in crops occurs in the upper 30 °C range. Nonetheless, the temperature sensitivity of tropical tree reproduction is virtually unstudied. (4) Mortality: How does heat-induced atmospheric drought (high leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit) affect tropical tree mortality? (5) Stomatal behavior: What is the specific role of temperature in the induction of midday-stomtal closure on sunny days? Better knowledge in these areas will improve our ability to predict carbon fluxes in tropical forests experiencing ongoing warming.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of heat tolerance of tropical trees have focused on canopy leaves exposed to full sunlight and high temperatures. However, in lowland tropical forests with leaf area indices of 5–6, the vast majority of leaves experience varying degrees of shade and a reduced heat load compared to sun leaves. Here we tested whether heat tolerance is lower in shade than in sun leaves. For three tropical tree species, Calophyllum inophyllum, Inga spectabilis, and Ormosia macrocalyx, disks of fully developed shade and sun leaves were subjected to 15-min heat treatments, followed by measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence after 48 h of recovery. In two of the three species, the temperature causing a 50\% decrease of the fluorescence ratio Fv/Fm (T50) was significantly lower (by \textasciitilde\,1.0 °C) in shade than in sun leaves, indicating a moderately decreased heat tolerance of shade leaves. In shade leaves of these two species, the rise in initial fluorescence, F0, also occurred at lower temperatures. In the third species, there was no shade-sun difference in T50. In situ measurements of photosynthetic C­ O2 assimilation showed that the optimum temperature for photosynthesis tended to be lower in shade leaves, although differences were not significant. At supra-optimal temperatures, photosynthesis was largely constrained by stomatal conductance, and the high-temperature C­ O2 compensation point, TMax, occurred at considerably lower temperatures than T50. Our study demonstrates that the temperature response of shade leaves of tropical trees differs only marginally from that of sun leaves, both in terms of heat tolerance and photosynthetic performance.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle, but little is known about the temperature response of photosynthetic carbon uptake in tropical species, and how this varies within and across forests. We determined in situ photosynthetic temperature–response curves for upper canopy leaves of 42 tree and liana species from two tropical forests in Panama with contrasting rainfall regimes. On the basis of seedling studies, we hypothesized that species with high photosynthetic capacity – light-demanding, fast-growing species – would have a higher temperature optimum of photosynthesis (TOpt) than species with low photosynthetic capacity – shade-tolerant, slow-growing species – and that, therefore, TOpt would scale with the position of a species on the slow–fast continuum of plant functional traits. TOpt was remarkably similar across species, regardless of their photosynthetic capacity and other plant functional traits. Community-average TOpt was almost identical to mean maximum daytime temperature, which was higher in the dry forest. Photosynthesis above TOpt appeared to be more strongly limited by stomatal conductance in the dry forest than in the wet forest. The observation that all species in a community shared similar TOpt values suggests that photosynthetic performance is optimized under current temperature regimes. These results should facilitate the scaling up of photosynthesis in relation to temperature from leaf to stand level in species-rich tropical forests.},

  abstract = {The scarcity of empirical data on leaf respiration (R) and its temperature sensitivity (e.g. Q10, defined as the proportional increase in R per 10 °C warming) causes uncertainty in current estimates of net primary productivity of tropical forests. We measured temperature response curves of R on 123 upper-canopy leaves of 28 species of trees and lianas from a tropical forest in Panama and analysed variations in R and Q10 in relation to other leaf functional traits. Respiration rates per leaf area at 25 °C (RA) varied widely among species and were significantly higher in trees than in lianas. RA was best predicted by a multiple regression model containing leaf phosphorus concentration, photosynthetic capacity and leaf mass per area (r2 = 0·64). The mean Q10 value (2·4) was significantly higher than the commonly assumed value of 2·0. Q10 was best predicted by the combination of leaf carbohydrate concentration and growth form (trees vs lianas) (r2 = 0·26). The night-time leaf respiratory carbon flux from this tropical forest was calculated from these multiple regression models to be 4·5 Mg C ha−1 year−1, with an estimated additional 2·9 Mg C ha−1 year−1 being released by respiration during the day. Trait-based modelling has potential for estimating R, thus facilitating carbon flux estimation in species-rich tropical forests. However, in contrast to global analyses, leaf phosphorus content was the most important correlate of R and not leaf nitrogen, so calibration of trait models to the tropics will be important. Leaf traits are poor predictors of Q10 values, and more empirical data on the temperature sensitivity of respiration are critically needed to further improve our ability to scale temperature-dependent respiration in species-rich tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests may be vulnerable to climate change1–3 if photosynthetic carbon uptake currently operates near a high temperature limit4–6. Predicting tropical forest function requires understanding the relative contributions of two mechanisms of high-temperature photosynthetic declines: stomatal limitation (H1), an indirect response due to temperature-associated changes in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD)7, and biochemical restrictions (H2), a direct temperature response8,9. Their relative control predicts different outcomes—H1 is expected to diminish with stomatal responses to future co-occurring elevated atmospheric [CO2], whereas H2 portends declining photosynthesis with increasing temperatures. Distinguishing the two mechanisms at high temperatures is therefore critical, but difficult because VPD is highly correlated with temperature in natural settings. We used a forest mesocosm to quantify the sensitivity of tropical gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) to future temperature regimes while constraining VPD by controlling humidity. We then analytically decoupled temperature and VPD effects under current climate with flux-tower-derived GEP trends in situ from four tropical forest sites. Both approaches showed consistent, negative sensitivity of GEP to VPD but little direct response to temperature. Importantly, in the mesocosm at low VPD, GEP persisted up to 38\,°C, a temperature exceeding projections for tropical forests in 2100 (ref. 10). If elevated [CO2] mitigates VPD-induced stomatal limitation through enhanced water-use efficiency as hypothesized9,11, tropical forest photosynthesis may have a margin of resilience to future warming.},

  abstract = {Seasonal dynamics in the vertical distribution of leaf area index (LAI) may impact the seasonality of forest productivity in Amazonian forests. However, until recently, fine-scale observations critical to revealing ecological mechanisms underlying these changes have been lacking. To investigate fine-scale variation in leaf area with seasonality and drought we conducted monthly ground-based LiDAR surveys over 4 yr at an Amazon forest site. We analysed temporal changes in vertically structured LAI along axes of both canopy height and light environments. Upper canopy LAI increased during the dry season, whereas lower canopy LAI decreased. The low canopy decrease was driven by highly illuminated leaves of smaller trees in gaps. By contrast, understory LAI increased concurrently with the upper canopy. Hence, tree phenological strategies were stratified by height and light environments. Trends were amplified during a 2015–2016 severe El Niño drought. Leaf area low in the canopy exhibited behaviour consistent with water limitation. Leaf loss from short trees in high light during drought may be associated with strategies to tolerate limited access to deep soil water and stressful leaf environments. Vertically and environmentally structured phenological processes suggest a critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in seasonal changes in Amazon ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {The response of forests to climate change depends in part on whether the photosynthetic benefit from increased atmospheric CO2 (∆Ca = future minus historic CO2) compensates for increased physiological stresses from higher temperature (∆T). We predicted the outcome of these competing responses by using optimization theory and a mechanistic model of tree water transport and photosynthesis. We simulated current and future productivity, stress, and mortality in mature monospecific stands with soil, species, and climate sampled from 20 continental US locations. We modeled stands with and without acclimation to ∆Ca and ∆T, where acclimated forests adjusted leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and stand density to maximize productivity while avoiding stress. Without acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in net primary productivity (NPP) was compromised by ∆T-driven stress and mortality associated with vascular failure. With acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in NPP and stand biomass (C storage) was accentuated for cooler futures but negated for warmer futures by a ∆T-driven reduction in NPP and biomass. Thus, hotter futures reduced forest biomass through either mortality or acclimation. Forest outcomes depended on whether projected climatic ∆Ca/∆T ratios were above or below physiological thresholds that neutralized the negative impacts of warming. Critically, if forests do not acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must be above ca. 89 ppm⋅°C−1 to avoid chronic stress, a threshold met by 55\% of climate projections. If forests do acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must rise above ca. 67 ppm⋅°C−1 for NPP and biomass to increase, a lower threshold met by 71\% of projections.},

  abstract = {Tropical ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented rates of degradation from deforestation, fire, and drought disturbances. The collective effects of these disturbances threaten to shift large portions of tropical ecosystems such as Amazon forests into savanna-like structure via tree loss, functional changes, and the emergence of fire (savannization). Changes from forest states to a more open savanna-like structure can affect local microclimates, surface energy fluxes, and biosphere–atmosphere interactions. A predominant type of ecosystem state change is the loss of tree cover and structural complexity in disturbed forest. Although important advances have been made contrasting energy fluxes between historically distinct old-growth forest and savanna systems, the emergence of secondary forests and savanna-like ecosystems necessitates a reframing to consider gradients of tree structure that span forest to savanna-like states at multiple scales. In this Innovative Viewpoint, we draw from the literature on forest–grassland continua to develop a framework to assess the consequences of tropical forest degradation on surface energy fluxes and canopy structure. We illustrate this framework for forest sites with contrasting canopy structure that ranges from simple, open, and savanna-like to complex and closed, representative of tropical wet forest, within two climatically distinct regions in the Amazon. Using a recently developed rapid field assessment approach, we quantify differences in cover, leaf area vertical profiles, surface roughness, albedo, and energy balance partitioning between adjacent sites and compare canopy structure with adjacent old-growth forest; more structurally simple forests displayed lower net radiation. To address forest–atmosphere feedback, we also consider the effects of canopy structure change on susceptibility to additional future disturbance. We illustrate a converse transition—recovery in structure following disturbance—measuring forest canopy structure 10 yr after the imposition of a 5-yr drought in the ground-breaking Seca Floresta experiment. Our approach strategically enables rapid characterization of surface properties relevant to vegetation models following degradation, and advances links between surface properties and canopy structure variables, increasingly available from remote sensing. Concluding, we hypothesize that understanding surface energy balance and microclimate change across degraded tropical forest states not only reveals critical atmospheric forcing, but also critical local-scale feedbacks from forest sensitivity to additional climate-linked disturbance.},

  abstract = {The results of a 3 year field study to observe the processes controlling snow interception by forest canopies and under canopy snow accumulation and ablation in mountain maritime climates are reported. The field study was further intended to provide data to develop and test models of forest canopy effects on beneath-canopy snowpack accumulation and melt and the plot and stand scales. Weighing lysimeters, cut-tree experiments, and manual snow surveys were deployed at a site in the Umpqua National Forest, Oregon (elevation 1200 m). A unique design for a weighing lysimeter was employed that allowed continuous measurements of snowpack evolution beneath a forest canopy to be taken at a scale unaffected by variability in canopy throughfall. Continuous observations of snowpack evolution in large clearings were made coincidentally with the canopy measurements. Large differences in snow accumulation and ablation were observed at sites beneath the forest canopy and in large clearings. These differences were not well described by simple relationships between the sites. Over the study period, approximately 60\% of snowfall was intercepted by the canopy (up to a maximum of about 40 mm water equivalent). Instantaneous sublimation rates exceeded 0.5 mm per hour for short periods. However, apparent average sublimation from the intercepted snow was less than 1 mm per day and totaled approximately 100 mm per winter season. Approximately 72 and 28\% of the remaining intercepted snow was removed as meltwater drip and large snow masses, respectively. Observed differences in snow interception rate and maximum snow interception capacity between Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) were minimal.},

Microrefugia allowed populations to survive adverse climatic conditions in the past2,3, but their potential to reduce extinction risk from anthropogenic warming is poorly understood3–5, hindering our capacity to develop robust in situ measures to adapt conservation to climate change⁶. Here, we show that microclimatic heterogeneity has strongly buffered species against regional extirpations linked to recent climate change. Using more than five million distribution records for 430 climate-threatened and range-declining species, population losses across England are found to be reduced in areas where topography generated greater variation in the microclimate. The buffering effect of topographic microclimates was strongest for those species adversely affected by warming and in areas that experienced the highest levels of warming: in such conditions, extirpation risk was reduced by 22\% for plants and by 9\% for insects. Our results indicate the critical role of topographic variation in creating microrefugia, and provide empirical evidence that microclimatic heterogeneity can substantially reduce extinction risk from climate change.},

  abstract = {Thermal sensitivity of tropical trees A key uncertainty in climate change models is the thermal sensitivity of tropical forests and how this value might influence carbon fluxes. Sullivan et al. measured carbon stocks and fluxes in permanent forest plots distributed globally. This synthesis of plot networks across climatic and biogeographic gradients shows that forest thermal sensitivity is dominated by high daytime temperatures. This extreme condition depresses growth rates and shortens the time that carbon resides in the ecosystem by killing trees under hot, dry conditions. The effect of temperature is worse above 32°C, and a greater magnitude of climate change thus risks greater loss of tropical forest carbon stocks. Nevertheless, forest carbon stocks are likely to remain higher under moderate climate change if they are protected from direct impacts such as clearance, logging, or fires. Science, this issue p. 869 The sensitivity of tropical forest carbon to climate is a key uncertainty in predicting global climate change. Although short-term drying and warming are known to affect forests, it is unknown if such effects translate into long-term responses. Here, we analyze 590 permanent plots measured across the tropics to derive the equilibrium climate controls on forest carbon. Maximum temperature is the most important predictor of aboveground biomass (−9.1 megagrams of carbon per hectare per degree Celsius), primarily by reducing woody productivity, and has a greater impact per °C in the hottest forests ({$>$}32.2°C). Our results nevertheless reveal greater thermal resilience than observations of short-term variation imply. To realize the long-term climate adaptation potential of tropical forests requires both protecting them and stabilizing Earth’s climate. Biome-wide variation in tropical forest carbon stocks and dynamics shows long-term resilience to increasing high temperatures.

  abstract = {Experimental research shows that isoprene emission by plants can improve photosynthetic performance at high temperatures. But whether species that emit isoprene have higher thermal limits than non‐emitting species remains largely untested. Tropical plants are adapted to narrow temperature ranges and global warming could result in significant ecosystem restructuring due to small variations in species' thermal tolerances. We compared photosynthetic temperature responses of 26 co‐occurring tropical tree and liana species to test whether isoprene‐emitting species are more tolerant to high temperatures. We classified species as isoprene emitters versus non‐emitters based on published datasets. Maximum temperatures for net photosynthesis were \textasciitilde 1.8°C higher for isoprene‐emitting species than for non‐emitters, and thermal response curves were 24\% wider; differences in optimum temperatures (Topt) or photosynthetic rates at Topt were not significant. Modelling the carbon cost of isoprene emission, we show that even strong emission rates cause little reduction in the net carbon assimilation advantage over non‐emitters at supraoptimal temperatures. Isoprene emissions may alleviate biochemical limitations, which together with stomatal conductance, co‐limit photosynthesis above Topt. Our findings provide evidence that isoprene emission may be an adaptation to warmer thermal niches, and that emitting species may fare better under global warming than co‐occurring non‐emitting species.},

It is projected that the global land area experiencing heat waves will double by 2020, and quadruple by 2040. Extreme heat events can impact a wide variety of tree functions. At the leaf level, photosynthesis is reduced, photo-oxidative stress increases, leaves abscise, and the growth rate of remaining leaves decreases. In some species, stomatal conductance increases at high temperatures, which may be a mechanism for leaf cooling. At the whole plant level, heat stress can decrease growth and shift biomass allocation. When drought stress accompanies heat waves, the negative effects of heat stress are exacerbated and can lead to tree mortality. However, some species exhibit remarkable tolerance to thermal stress. Responses include changes that minimize stress on photosynthesis and reductions in dark respiration. Although there have been few studies to date, there is evidence of within-species genetic variation in thermal tolerance which could be important to exploit in production forestry systems. Understanding the mechanisms of differing tree responses to extreme temperature events may be critically important for understanding how tree species will be affected by climate change.},

  abstract = {More frequent and severe disturbances increasingly open the forest canopy and initiate tree regeneration. Simultaneously, increasing weather extremes, such as drought and heat, are threatening species adapted to cool and moist climate. The magnitude of the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies to mitigate hot and dry weather conditions and its disturbance-induced reduction remains poorly quantified. Also, the influence of disturbance legacies (e.g., deadwood) on forest microclimate is unresolved. In a unique manipulation experiment we investigated (i) the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies in years with different climatic conditions; (ii) the impacts of spatial disturbance patterns on surface light and microclimate; and (iii) the effect of deadwood presence and type on microclimate. Treatments included two disturbance patterns (i.e., aggregated and distributed), four deadwood types (i.e., standing, downed, standing and downed, removed), and one untreated control (i.e., nine treatments in total), replicated at five sites dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in southeastern Germany. We measured forest floor light conditions and derived diurnal extremes and variation in temperature (T) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during four consecutive summer seasons (2016 – 2019). The buffering capacity of intact forest canopies was higher in warm and dry years. Surface light was significantly higher in spatially aggregated disturbance gaps compared to distributed disturbances of similar severity. An increase in surface light by 10 \% relative to closed canopies elevated Tmax and VPDmax by 0.42°C and 0.04 kPa, respectively. Deadwood presence and type did not affect the forest microclimate significantly. Microclimatic buffering under forest canopies can dampen the effects of climate change. However, increasing canopy disturbances result in more light penetrating the canopy, reducing the microclimatic buffering capacity of forests. We conclude that forest management should foster microclimatic buffering in forests as one element of a multi-pronged strategy to counter climate change.},

Temperate-zone broadleaf and conifer tree species, ranging widely in shade tolerance, were investigated from one locality in the Czech Republic. The study species included strongly shade-tolerant Abies alba Mill. and Tilia cordata Mill., less shade-tolerant Fagus sylvatica L. and Acer pseudoplatanus L. and sun-demanding Picea abies (L.) Karst. In the fully activated photosynthetic state, sun foliage of all species had significantly higher maximum CO(2) assimilation rates, maximum stomatal conductance and maximum rates of carboxylation than shade foliage. Compared with shade leaves, sun leaves had significantly higher nocturnal stomatal conductances. In all species, shade foliage tended to have higher induction states 60 s after leaf illumination than sun foliage. Sun and shade foliage did not differ in the rate of disappearance of the transient biochemical limitation during the induction phase. Longer time periods were required to reach 90\% photosynthetic induction and 90\% stomatal induction in sun foliage than in shade foliage of the less shade-tolerant F. sylvatica and A. pseudoplatanus and in sun-demanding P. abies; however, in sun foliage of the strongly shade-tolerant species T. cordata and A. alba, the time needed for photosynthetic induction was similar to, or less than, that for shade foliage. Shade but not sun needles of P. abies and A. alba had significantly slower induction kinetics than the broadleaf tree species. Among species, the sun-demanding P. abies exhibited the shortest stomatal induction times in both sun and shade leaves. Independently of shade tolerance ranking, the transient stomatal and total limitations that characterize photosynthetic induction were relieved significantly earlier in shade foliage than in sun foliage. Sun foliage generally exhibited a hyperbolic photosynthetic induction response, whereas a sigmoidal induction response was more frequent in shade foliage. The different relative proportions of transient biochemical and stomatal limitations during photosynthetic induction in sun and shade foliage indicate an essential role of stomata in photosynthetic limitation during induction, mainly in shade foliage, with a consequent influence on the shape of the photosynthetic induction curve.},

  abstract = {Leaves absorb, scatter, and transmit sunlight at all wavelengths across the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared spectrum. The optical properties of a leaf are determined by its biochemical and biophysical characteristics, including its 3-D cellular organization. The absorption and scattering properties of leaves together create the shape of their reflectance spectra. Terrestrial seed plant species share similar physiological and metabolic processes for fluxes of gases (CO2, O2, H2O), nutrients, and energy, while differences are primarily consequences of how these properties are distributed and their physical structures. Related species generally share biochemical and biophysical traits, and their optical properties are also similar, providing a mechanism for identification. However, it is often the minor differences in spectral properties throughout the wavelengths of the solar spectrum that define a species or groups of related species. This chapter provides a review and summary of the most common interactions between leaf properties and light and the physical processes that regulate the outcomes of these interactions.},

  abstract = {Light gradients are ubiquitous in nature, so all plants are exposed to some degree of shade during their lifetime. The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among cooccurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO₂, climate change and the spread of invasive species.},

  abstract = {Shade, in ecological sense, is not merely a lack of light, but a multi-faceted phenomenon that creates new and complex settings for community and ecosystem dynamics. Tolerating shade therefore affects plants’ ability to cope with other stressors, and also shape its interactions with surrounding organisms. The aim of this broad review was to map our current knowledge about how shade affects plants, plant communities and ecosystems – to gather together knowledge of what we know, but also to point out what we do not yet know. This review covers the following topics: the nature of shade, and ecological and physiological complexities related to growing under a canopy; plants’ capability of tolerating other stress factors while living under a shade – resource trade-offs and polytolerance of abiotic stress; ontogenetic effects of shade tolerance; coexistence patterns under the canopy – how shade determines the forest structure and diversity; shade-induced abiotic dynamics in understorey vegetation, including changing patterns of irradiance, temperature and humidity under the canopy; shade-driven plant–plant and plant–animal interactions – how shade mediates facilitation and stress, and how it creates differentiated environment for different herbivores and pollinators, including the role of volatile organic compounds. We also discuss the ways how vegetation in understorey environments will be affected by climate change, as shade might play a significant role in mitigating negative effects of climate change. Our review shows that living under a shade affects biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of plants, it also influences the outcomes of both symbiotic and competitive plant–plant and plant–animal interactions in a complex and dynamic manner. The current knowledge of shade-related mechanisms is rather ample, however there is much room for progress in integrating different implications of the multifaceted nature of shade into consistent and integral understanding how communities and ecosystems function.},

At the top canopy level (CL28m) of the adult beech, CCI and leaf anatomy reflected higher light stress, while gsmaxincreased with height, reflecting the importance of gas exchange in the upper canopy layer. Leaf wettability, measured as drop contact angle, decreased from 85.5°~±~1.6° (summer) to 57.5°~±~2.8° (autumn) at CL28m of the adult tree. At CL22m, adult beech leaves seemed to be better optimized for photosynthesis than the CL28m leaves because of a large leaf thickness with less protective and impregnated substances, and a higher CCI. The beech saplings, in contrast, did not adapt their stomatal characteristics and leaf anatomy according to the same strategy as the adult beech leaves. Consequently, care is needed when scaling up experimental results from seedlings to adult trees.},

Leaf gas exchange responses to carbon dioxide (CO2 ) at different temperatures (20-40°C) were used to assess the temperature responses of biochemical photosynthetic capacities. Analyses revealed a lower optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport rates than for Rubisco carboxylation rates, along with lower electron transport optima in the native cold-adapted than in the exotic warm-adapted species. The photosynthetic optimum temperatures were generally exceeded by daytime peak leaf temperatures, in particular in the native montane rainforest climax species. This study thus provides evidence of pronounced negative effects of high temperature in tropical trees and indicates high susceptibility of montane rainforest climax species to future global warming.},

  abstract = {In temperate climates, seedlings and saplings have often been assumed to be more sensitive to late-spring freezes than conspecific adult trees. Yet, no data are available to compare the freezing resistance of juvenile and adult trees at their phenologically most sensitive stage, that is, during leaf-out. Emerging leaves of seedlings, saplings and adult trees were collected in spring 2013 in seven temperate tree species in a mature mixed forest in the foothills of the Swiss Jura Mountains. Freezing resistance of these emerging leaves was assessed using different target temperatures (−13 to +4 °C) in seven computer-controlled freezers. Additionally, we assessed the risk that species encounter freeze damages based on temperature data recorded since 1898. The different study species showed contrasting freezing resistance, with the LT50 (median lethal freezing temperature) of emerging leaves ranging from −3.5 ± 0.2 °C (Fraxinus excelsior) to −8.3 ± 0.2 °C (Prunus avium). Within species, juvenile trees (seedlings or saplings) were found to be as sensitive to freezing temperatures as mature trees when the same developmental stage of foliage was compared. Based on phenological observations made during spring 2012, long time series of temperatures indicate a very low risk of freeze damage at the study site, especially for adult trees. Synthesis. We conclude that seedlings and saplings are more prone to freeze damage than adult trees because of their earlier flushing rather than due to a higher sensitivity to freezing as such. Our study highlights that the timing of spring phenology has evolved in such a way that it minimizes the risk of freeze damage according to the species-specific LT50. Early flushing species are among the most freezing-resistant species during flushing, whereas late flushing species are among the least resistant. We conclude that for the examined species the species-specific freezing resistance during leaf emergence could be extracted from either adult or juvenile trees, as long as it is estimated at a same phenological stage.},

With the centres of the plates 15°C above ambient temperature, their heat dissipation was measured at wind velocities of \&lt;1, 10, and 30 cm s−1 from below and laterally with horizontal and vertical plate orientations. Even very slight forced-air movements markedly increased heat dissipation in this range of mixed free and forced convection. Lobed plates were more effective dissipators than circles, with the greatest differences occurring where flow was normal to the plate. Circular plates dissipated about one-fourth more heat when vertical than when horizontal in still air (free convection). By contrast, dissipation was essentially independent of orientation for extensively lobed models. Under some circumstances, maximum dissipation occurred with lobed plates oblique to a forced air stream. Physical explanations and biological implications of these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Forest canopy generally moderates below-canopy air temperature and relative humidity and thus creates a specific microclimate for tree seedling growth. Climate change will alter the moderating capacity, which may render the below-canopy conditions unsuitable for recruitment of the hitherto dominant tree species. We assigned long-term meteorological data (1997–2010) recorded inside and outside of 14 different forest ecosystems in Switzerland to three forest types (broadleaved, non-pine conifer, pine), two altitudinal levels (low, high), the four seasons and general weather situations (normal, hot/dry, cold/wet) to compare moderating capacity of each of these classifiers. Our results confirmed a general moderating effect of canopy on below-canopy microclimate with a decrease of daily maximum air temperature of up to 5.1 ◦C (overall average: 1.8 ◦C) and an increase of daily minimum relative humidity of up to 12.4\% (overall average: 5.1\%) in the long-term average, respectively. Broadleaved and non-pine conifer forests moderated daytime microclimate about twice as much as pine forests, while at nighttime considerably less cooling down and even negative effects on levels of relative humidity compared to the open area were recorded at the pine forest sites. Moderating capacity was stronger at low altitude than at high altitude. It was strongest during the growing season, particularly in summer, and depended in a complex way on the general weather situation. Deviations from the general seasonal and weather condition patterns most likely occurred when soil moisture pools were depleted. Despite the moderating capacity, below-canopy microclimate did not lag behind open area microclimate. Based on our results we conclude that natural recruitment in pine forests and high-altitude forests may respond most sensitively to climate change.},

  abstract = {Leaf size (i.e. leaf surface area and leaf dry mass) profoundly affects a variety of biological carbon, water and energy processes. Therefore, the remarkable variability in individual leaf size and its trade-off with total leaf number in a plant have particularly important implications for understanding the adaption strategy of plants to environmental changes. The various leaf sizes of plants growing in the same habitat are expected to have distinct abilities of thermal regulation influencing leaf water loss and shedding heat. Here, we sampled 16 tree species co-occurring in a temperate forest in northeastern China to quantify the variation of leaf, stomata and twigs traits, and to determine the relationships of leaf size with leaf number and leaf water loss. We examined the right-skewed distributions of leaf size, leafing intensity, stomatal size and stomatal density across species. Leafing intensity was significantly negatively correlated with leaf size, accounting for 4\% and 12\% of variation in leaf area and leaf mass, respectively. Species was the most important factor in explaining the variation in leaf size (conditional R2 of 0.92 for leaf area and 0.82 for leaf mass). Leaf area and mass significantly increased with increasing diameter of twigs. Leaf water loss was strongly negatively correlated with leaf area and leaf mass during the first four hours of the measurement. Leaf area and leaf mass accounted for 38\% and 30\% of variation in total leaf water loss, respectively. Leaf water loss rate (k) was significantly different among tree species and markedly linearly decreased with increasing leaf area and leaf mass for simple-leaved tree species. In conclusion, the existence of a cross-species trade-off between the size of individual leaves and the number of leaves per yearly twig unit was confirmed in that temperate forest. There was strongly negative correlation between leaf water loss and leaf size across tree species, which provides evidences for leaf size in leaf temperature regulation in dry environment with strong radiation. The size-dependent leaf water relation is of central importance to recognize the functional role of leaf size in a changing climate including rapid changes in air temperature and rainfall.},

  abstract = {Aim In response to environmental changes and to avoid extinction, species may either track suitable environmental conditions or adapt to the modified environment. However, whether and how species adapt to environmental changes remains unclear. By focusing on the realized niche (i.e. the actual space that a species inhabits and the resources it can access as a result of limiting biotic factors present in its habitat), we here examine shifts in the realized-niche width (i.e. ecological amplitude) and position (i.e. ecological optimum) of 26 common and widespread forest understorey plants across their distributional ranges. Location Temperate forests along a ca. 1800-km-long latitudinal gradient from northern France to central Sweden and Estonia. Methods We derived species' realized-niche width from a β-diversity metric, which increases if the focal species co-occurs with more species. Based on the concept that species' scores in a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) represent the locations of their realized-niche positions, we developed a novel approach to run species-specific DCAs allowing the focal species to shift its realized-niche position along the studied latitudinal gradient while the realized-niche positions of other species were held constant. Results None of the 26 species maintained both their realized-niche width and position along the latitudinal gradient. Few species (9 of 26: 35\%) shifted their realized-niche width, but all shifted their realized-niche position. With increasing latitude, most species (22 of 26: 85\%) shifted their realized-niche position for soil nutrients and pH towards nutrient-poorer and more acidic soils. Main conclusions Forest understorey plants shifted their realized niche along the latitudinal gradient, suggesting local adaptation and/or plasticity. This macroecological pattern casts doubt on the idea that the realized niche is stable in space and time, which is a key assumption of species distribution models used to predict the future of biodiversity, hence raising concern about predicted extinction rates.},

We also examine the potential effects of climate change stresses (including elevated temperatures, rising CO2 concentrations and drought) on the ability of tree species to use sunflecks, and advocate more research to improve our predictions of seedling and tree carbon gain in future climates. Lastly, while we have the ability to model realistic responses of photosynthesis to fluctuating PFD, dynamic responses of photosynthesis to sunflecks are not accounted for in current models of canopy carbon uptake, which can lead to substantial overestimates of forest carbon fixation. Since sunflecks are a critical component of seasonal carbon gain for shaded leaves, sunfleck regimes and physiological responses to sunflecks should be incorporated into models to more accurately capture forest carbon dynamics.},

  abstract = {Organ temperature and variation therein plays a key role in plant functioning and its responses to e.g. climate change. There is a strong feedback between organ, especially leaf, temperature and the climate within the canopy (canopy climate), which in turn interacts with the climate outside the canopy (ambient climate). For greenhouses, the determinants of this interplay and how they drive differences between canopy and ambient climate are poorly understood. Yet, as many experiments on both regular greenhouse crops and field crops are done in greenhouses, this is crucial to know. Therefore, we designed an experiment to quantify the differences between ambient and canopy climate and leaf temperature. A path analysis was performed to quantify the interactions between components of the greenhouse canopy-climate system. We found that with high radiation the canopy climate can be up to 5°C cooler than the ambient climate, while for cloudy days this was only 2°C. Canopy relative humidity (RH) was up to 25\% higher compared to ambient RH. We showed that radiation is very important for these climate differences, but that this effect could be partly counteracted by turning off supplementary light (i.e. due to its indirect effects e.g. changing light distribution). Leaf temperature was substantially different, both higher and lower, from the canopy air temperature. This difference was determined by leaf area index (LAI), temperature of the heating pipe and the use of supplementary light, which all strongly influence radiation, either shortwave or thermal radiation. The difference between leaf and ambient air temperature could be decreased by decreasing the LAI or increasing the temperature of the heating pipe.},

  abstract = {A trade-off between growth and mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated conditions under which the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r2 = 0.69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r2 = 0.46), and much weaker for large trees (r2 ≤ 0.10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (Hmax) are key traits among forest trees. Seed mass, LMA, WD, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait–demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of WD, the relationships were weak (r2 {$<$} 0.1 for three and r2 {$<$} 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43–44\% of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth–mortality trade-off; however, WD alone accounted for {$>$}80\% of the explained variation and, after WD was included, LMA and Hmax made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of SM, LMA, and Hmax occurred at all positions on the growth–mortality trade-off. Although WD provides a promising start, a successful trait-based ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

  abstract = {Leaf size, climate, and energy balance Why does plant leaf size increase at lower latitudes, as exemplified by the evolutionary success of species with very large leaves in the tropics? Wright et al. analyzed leaf data for 7670 plant species, along with climatic data, from 682 sites worldwide. Their findings reveal consistent patterns and explain why earlier predictions from energy balance theory had only limited success. The authors provide a fully quantitative explanation for the latitudinal gradient in leaf size, with implications for plant ecology and physiology, vegetation modeling, and paleobotany. Science, this issue p. 917 Leaf size varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large leaves, the latitudinal gradient of leaf size has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic gradients in leaf size. This knowledge can enrich “next-generation” vegetation models in which leaf temperature and water use during photosynthesis play key roles. Day- and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences drive global gradients in leaf size. Day- and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences drive global gradients in leaf size.},

We quantified gradients of light availability, LMA, leaf N and phosphorus (P), and leaf angle along leaf age sequences and vertical canopy profiles, across 28 woody species from open habitats in eastern Australia. The observed trends in LMA, Narea and leaf angle largely conflicted with expectations from canopy optimisation models, whereas trends in leaf P were more consistent with optimal allocation. These discrepancies most likely relate to these species having rather open canopies with quite shallow light gradients, but also suggest that modelling the co-optimisation of resources other than nitrogen is required for understanding plant canopies.},

  abstract = {In conjunction with eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes at the 39.5-m height over a 21.5-m-tall boreal aspen stand in northern Saskatchewan, CO2 concentration was measured at eight heights in order to calculate net ecosystem exchange. During both leafless and full-leaf periods, daytime vertical CO2 concentration gradients above 9 m were weak ({$<$}0.2 μmol mol−1 m−1), but were strong below this height. Little change in CO2 storage in the air column below 39.5 m occurred during much of the daytime, while around sunrise and sunset CO2 storage changed mainly below 9 m. For the rest of the night, over 85\% of the increase in CO2 storage occurred above 9 m. On some calm nights during the growing season, CO2 also accumulated below 9 m resulting in a sudden upward CO2 flux at 39.5 m following the resumption of mixing 2–3 hours after sunrise. A 10-day experiment was conducted to determine the spatial variability of CO2 flux in the trunk space. Two eddy covariance systems were mounted just above the understory about two tree heights apart. The correlation between CO2 fluxes were poor even under unstable (daytime) conditions, suggesting a relatively heterogeneous understory and soil. In contrast, the correlation between water vapor fluxes was high (r2 = 0.70) in unstable conditions. However, average daytime and nighttime CO2 fluxes over the 10 days agreed to within 5\%. This suggests that partitioning net ecosystem exchange between overstory and understory on an hourly basis using a single-understory eddy covariance system is inadvisable; however, partitioning probably can be done quite reliably using 5-day average fluxes.},

  abstract = {Diurnal patterns of chlorophyll a fluorescence transient kinetics in leaves from the east (E) and west (W) sides of the ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) canopy were studied on sunny day. The results showed that the performance index on a basis of absorption (PIabs), maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) and potential activity of PS II (F-v/F-0) in the leaves from the E decreased more drastically than those from the W at noon, suggesting the severe photoinhibition in the leaves from the E. However, the photoinhibition was more severe in the leaves from the W in the afternoon. With the variation of photon flux density (PFD), ratio of variable fluorescence F-k to the amplitude F-J - F-o (W-k) increased firstly, then followed by a decrease in the two group leaves. However, efficiency that a trapped exciton moves an electron into the electron transport chain beyond Q(A)(-) (Psi(o)) and probability that an absorbed photon will move an electron into the electron transport chain (phi E-o) decreased firstly, then followed by an increase in the two group leaves. These results demonstrate that both the donor and acceptor sides of PS II were damaged in the leaves in different directions. Diurnal changes in dissipation per active reaction center indicate that the excessively excited energy per active reaction center was higher in the leaves from the E at noon while that was higher in the leaves from the W in the afternoon. The results also exhibited that Pl(abs) are more sensitive to the variation of PFD and can reflect the extent of photoinhibition in ginkgo leaves in more detail, compared with F-v/F-m, and F-v/F-o.}

  abstract = {Local factors restrain forest warming Microclimates are key to understanding how organisms and ecosystems respond to macroclimate change, yet they are frequently neglected when studying biotic responses to global change. Zellweger et al. provide a long-term, continental-scale assessment of the effects of micro- and macroclimate on the community composition of European forests (see the Perspective by Lembrechts and Nijs). They show that changes in forest canopy cover are fundamentally important for driving community responses to climate change. Closed canopies buffer against the effects of macroclimatic change through their cooling effect, slowing shifts in community composition, whereas open canopies tend to accelerate community change through local heating effects.

  abstract = {Ongoing global warming is causing phenological shifts that affect photosynthesis and growth rates in temperate woody species. However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warming—as is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn months—on autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4~°C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group. This underscores the need to consider differences among plant functional types when forecasting the future behaviour of ecosystems.},
