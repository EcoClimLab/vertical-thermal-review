  abstract = {Fire is an increasingly important agent of forest degradation in the Amazon, but little attention has been given to the susceptibility of seasonally flooded forests to fire. Satellite images suggest that forests flooded seasonally by nutrient-poor black waters are more susceptible to fire and may suffer greater fire damage than nearby upland forests. Reasons for this difference may include the presence of a root mat, more fine fuel as litter and a drier understory in the flooded forest. We investigated this difference in the field, hypothesizing that differences in the aboveground structure of the pre-burn forest can contribute to the difference in impacts of, and susceptibility to, fires. We employed a portable profiling LiDAR (PPL), first to compare damage between adjacent black water seasonally flooded and upland forests that were burned by the same fire event, and to then assess prefire canopy structure attributes known to affect fire susceptibility. For both assessments, we used PPL-derived metrics of leaf area and vertical and horizontal variation in the structure of vegetation in the canopy. Four years after the fire, the LiDAR metrics showed greater combined effects of high damage and slow recovery in the seasonally flooded forest; reduction of total Leaf Area Index (LAI) after burning was only 10\% for upland forest but was 71\% in the flood forest. Compared to unburned upland, the canopy of unburned flood forest had structural differences that increase susceptibility to fire, including drier microclimate. It had more gaps, a more open understory and a lower upper canopy. Small patches lacking canopy closure (LAI b 1.0) were far more abundant in the unburned flood forest. We conclude that black water seasonally flooded forest suffers greater fire damage than upland forest and canopy structure contributes to its greater susceptibility to the occurrence of fires. This must be considered in assessments of future Amazon fire risks and impacts, including flood forest acting as a potential conduit for spreading fire to upland forest.},

  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon (C) cycle and thereby strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO2 accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale synthesis on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world’s forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use 11 923 ForC records for 34 C cycle variables from 865 geographic locations to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types—tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal. We calculate means and standard deviations for both mature and regrowth (age {$<$} 100 years) forests and quantify trends with stand age in regrowth forests for all variables with sufficient data. C cycling rates generally decreased from tropical to temperate to boreal in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. Mature forest net ecosystem production did not differ significantly among biomes. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with the logarithm of stand age. As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This comprehensive and synthetic global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages contributes to these efforts.},

  abstract = {Many morphological, physiological and ecological traits of trees scale with diameter, shaping the structure and function of forest ecosystems. Understanding the mechanistic basis for such scaling relationships is key to understanding forests globally and their role in Earth's changing climate system. Here, we evaluate theoretical predictions for the scaling of nine variables in a mixed-age temperate deciduous forest (CTFS-ForestGEO forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Virginia, USA) and compare observed scaling parameters to those from other forests world-wide. We examine fifteen species and various environmental conditions. Structural, physiological and ecological traits of trees scaled with stem diameter in a manner that was sometimes consistent with existing theoretical predictions – more commonly with those predicting a range of scaling values than a single universal scaling value. Scaling relationships were variable among species, reflecting substantive ecological differences. Scaling relationships varied considerably with environmental conditions. For instance, the scaling of sap flux density varied with atmospheric moisture demand, and herbivore browsing dramatically influenced stem abundance scaling. Thus, stand-level, time-averaged scaling relationships (e.g., the scaling of diameter growth) are underlain by a diversity of species-level scaling relationships that can vary substantially with fluctuating environmental conditions. In order to use scaling theory to accurately characterize forest ecosystems and predict their responses to global change, it will be critical to develop a more nuanced understanding of both the forces that constrain stand-level scaling and the complexity of scaling variation across species and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Leaf respiration (R) is a major component of carbon balance in forest ecosystems. Clarifying the variability of leaf R within a canopy is essential for predicting the impact of global warming on forest productivity and the potential future function of the forest ecosystem as a carbon sink. We examined vertical and seasonal variations in short-term temperature responses of leaf R as well as environmental factors (light and mean air temperature) and physiological factors [leaf nitrogen (N), leaf mass per area (LMA), and shoot growth] in the canopy of a 10-year-old stand of hinoki cypress [Chamaecyparis obtusa (Sieb. et Zucc.) Endl.] in Kyushu, Japan. Leaf respiration rate adjusted to 20 °C (R20) exhibited evident vertical gradients in each season and was correlated with light, LMA and leaf N. In contrast, the temperature sensitivity of leaf R (Q10) did not vary vertically throughout the seasons. Seasonally, Q10 was higher in winter than in summer and was strongly negatively correlated to mean air temperature. A negative correlation of R20 with mean air temperature was also observed for each of the three canopy layers. These results clearly indicate that leaf R was able to adjust to seasonal changes in ambient temperature under field conditions and down-regulate during warmer periods. We also found that the degree of thermal acclimation did not vary with canopy position. Overall, our results suggest that vertical and seasonal variations in temperature responses of leaf R within a hinoki cypress canopy could be predicted by relatively simple parameters (light and temperature). There was an exception of extremely high R20 values in April that may have been due to the onset of shoot growth in spring. Understanding thermal acclimation and variations in leaf R within forest canopies will improve global terrestrial carbon cycle models.},

Relationships between lowland rain-forest structure, dynamics and site conditions were examined by the establishment of plots and profile diagrams within mature-phase forest at 13 sites and with permanent plots at three of these sites where trees have been enumerated over 20 years. 2. Most forest structural measures were intercorrelated but forest stature was uncorrelated with HCl-extractable soil nutrient concentrations and was apparently related to topography, soil depth and soil water. The relationship between diameter and height varied between forests and was correlated with HCl-extractable P and Mg for dry-land sites. 3. Tall forests generally had more slender canopy trees for a given height than short forests. Vertical stratification was associated with the presence and stand density of emergent trees, which comprise an architecturally and floristically distinct guild. Where emergents are scattered or absent, the main canopy and understorey were dense and no vertical stratification of crowns was perceptible; where emergents formed a continuous canopy, the main canopy was sparse, the understorey less dense and tree crowns were more separated into two horizontal strata. This type of forest appears to be confined to continuously moist soils on lower slopes, flat or undulating land. 4. Leaf size in the subcanopy was positively correlated with measured soil nutrients, and with the relationship between diameter and height. Among canopy trees it was not correlated with soil nutrients, nor with other aspects of forest structure. 5. Plots were originally established within mature phase, avoiding canopy gaps. Since establishment, gaps have accumulated within the permanent plots. Tree mortality was significantly clustered on clay soils, but not on sandy soils where windthrow was apparently less frequent and trees more often died standing. 6. Mean proportional diameter increments of large trees were not correlated with measured soil nutrients; but mean proportional diameter increments of recruits were correlated with measured soil nutrients. 7. A guild of tree species with the seed and/or seedling characteristics and the fast growth of pioneers, but with plagiotropic branching and crowns which reach the forest canopy or even emerge above it, was an important component of the building phase on soils with high mineral concentrations, but was sparsely distributed on other soils. 8. Standing volume and net volume increment were dominated by the mature phase; but soil nutrients probably influenced volume increment in the building phase. 9. Two inland forests, Bukit Mersing and Lambir, exhibited no net change in stand volume over 20 years. At Bako, a coastal forest on shallow freely draining soils, stand volume increased by 15.9\% of the initial measurement. This increment occurred among trees of the largest diameter class while there was a net loss of volume in the small classes.},

Does physiological acclimation to climate warming mirror acclimation to seasonal temperature changes? We grew Eucalyptus tereticornis trees in the field for 14 months inside 9-m tall whole-tree chambers tracking ambient air temperature (Tair) or ambient Tair + 3°C (i.e. ‘warmed’). We measured light- and CO2-saturated net photosynthesis (Amax) and night-time dark respiration (R) each month at 25°C to quantify acclimation. Tree growth was measured, and leaf nitrogen (N) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations were determined to investigate mechanisms of acclimation. Warming reduced Amax and R measured at 25°C compared to ambient-grown trees. Both traits also declined as mean daily Tair increased, and did so in a similar way across temperature treatments. Amax and R (at 25°C) both increased as TNC concentrations increased seasonally; these relationships appeared to arise from source–sink imbalances, suggesting potential substrate regulation of thermal acclimation. We found that photosynthesis and respiration each acclimated equivalently to experimental warming and seasonal temperature change of a similar magnitude, reflecting a common, nearly homeostatic constraint on leaf carbon exchange that will be important in governing tree responses to climate warming.},

  abstract = {Leaf Optical Properties (LOPs) convey information relating to temporally dynamic photosynthetic activity and biochemistry. LOPs are also sensitive to variability in anatomically related traits such as Specific Leaf Area (SLA), via the interplay of intra-leaf light scattering and absorption processes. Therefore, variability in such traits, which may demonstrate little plasticity over time, potentially disrupts remote sensing estimates of photosynthesis or biochemistry across space. To help to disentangle the various factors that contribute to the variability of LOPs, we defined baseline variation as variation in LOPs that occurs across space, but not time. Next we hypothesized that there were two main controls of potentially disruptive baseline spatial variability of photosynthetically-related LOPs at our boreal forest site: light environment and species. We measured photosynthetically-related LOPs in conjunction with morphological, biochemical, and photosynthetic leaf traits during summer and across selected boreal tree species and vertical gradients in light environment. We then conducted a detailed correlation analysis to disentangle the spatial factors that control baseline variability of leaf traits and, resultantly, LOPs. Baseline spatial variability of the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) was strongly influenced by species and to a lesser extent light environment. Baseline variability of spectral fluorescence derived LOPs was less influenced by species; however at longer near-infrared wavelengths, light environment was an important control. In summary, remote sensing of chlorophyll fluorescence has good potential to detect variation in photosynthetic performance across space in boreal forests given reduced sensitivity to species related baseline variability in comparison to the PRI. Our results also imply that spatially coarse remote sensing observations are potentially unrepresentative of the full scope of natural variation that occurs within a boreal forest.},

Seedlings were hydroponically grown under constant 20°C, controlled-environment conditions. Measurements of R (using the Laisk method) and photosynthesis (at 37 Pa CO2) were made at several irradiances (0–2,000 μmol photons m−2 s−1) and temperatures (6°C–30°C). At 15°C to 30°C, substantial inhibition of R occurred at 12 μmol photons m−2 s−1, with maximum inhibition occurring at 100 to 200 μmol photons m−2 s−1. Higher irradiance had little additional effect on R at these moderate temperatures. The irradiance necessary to maximally inhibitR at 6°C to 10°C was lower than that at 15°C to 30°C. Moreover, although R was inhibited by low irradiance at 6°C to 10°C, it recovered with progressive increases in irradiance. The temperature sensitivity of R was greater in darkness than under bright light. At 30°C and high irradiance, light-inhibited rates of R represented 2\% of gross CO2 uptake (v ~c), whereas photorespiratory CO2 release was approximately 20\% of v ~c. If light had not inhibited leaf respiration at 30°C and high irradiance, R would have represented 11\% of v ~c. Variations in light inhibition of R can therefore have a substantial impact on the proportion of photosynthesis that is respired. We conclude that the rate of R in the light is highly variable, being dependent on irradiance and temperature.},

  abstract = {Respiration (R, non-photorespiratory mitochondrial CO2 release) in leaves is inhibited by light. However, exposure to darkness after a period of illumination can also result in R being temporarily stimulated (termed ‘light enhanced dark respiration’, LEDR). We used a fast-response CO2 exchange system to investigate these observations in tobacco leaves. After switching off the light, there were two peaks of CO2 release, the first at 15–20 s (the photorespiratory post-illumination burst) and the second at 180–250 s (LEDR). LEDR occurred in all post-illumination experiments, independent of O2 or CO2 concentration. However, LEDR increased with increasing irradiance during the pre-dark period, suggesting some dependency on prior photosynthesis. We investigated the inhibition of R by light at low CO2 concentrations (\&Ggr;*): \&Ggr;* is the intercellular CO2 concentration at which net CO2 release represents R in the light. The inhibition of R in the light took about 50 s and was even evident at 3 mmol photons m-2 s-1, regardless of the light quality (red, blue or white).

  abstract = {In a deciduous forest, differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and adult trees could result in juvenile trees avoiding canopy shade for part of the growing season. By expanding leaves earlier or initiating senescence later than canopy trees, juvenile trees would have some period in high light and therefore greater potential carbon gain. We observed leaf phenology of 376 individuals of 13 canopy tree species weekly over 3 years in a deciduous forest in east central Illinois, USA. Our objectives were: (1) to quantify for each species the extent of differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and conspecific adult trees; and (2) to determine the extent of phenological differences between juvenile Aesculus glabra Willd. and Acer saccharum Marsh. trees in understory and gap microhabitats. All species displayed phenological differences between life stages. For 10 species, bud break was significantly earlier, by an average of 8 days, for subcanopy individuals than for canopy individuals. In 11 species, completion of leaf expansion was earlier, by an average of 6 days, for subcanopy individuals than for canopy individuals. In contrast, there were no significant differences between life stages for start of senescence in 10 species and completion of leaf drop in nine species. For eight species, leaf longevity was significantly greater for subcanopy individuals than for canopy individuals by an average of 7 days (range = 4–10 days). Leaf phenology of subcanopy individuals of both Aesculus glabra and Acer saccharum responded to gap conditions. Leaf longevity was 11 days less in the understory than in gaps for Aesculus glabra, but 14 days more in the understory than in gaps for Acer saccharum. Therefore, leaf phenology differed broadly both between life stages and within the juvenile life stage in this community. A vertical gradient in temperature sums is the proposed mechanism explaining the patterns. Temperature sums accumulated more rapidly in the sheltered understory than in an open elevated area, similar to the canopy. Early leaf expansion by juvenile trees may result in a period of disproportionately higher carbon gain, similar to gains made during summer months from use of sun flecks.},

These effects depend on local climatic characteristics and stand type. All climatic parameters should be considered, but particular attention should be paid to temperature, light and water. From a silvicultural point of view knowledge of the interactions existing between microclimatic conditions and stands, in conjunction with information now available concerning tree ecophysiology make it possible to produce viable applications which are useful for silviculture during stand formation, and for applying silvicultural treatments. Whitout a doubt, taking forest cover interactions into account (climate and ecophysiological potential of species) is the basis of sustainable management in forests. Based on the current knowledge about young stands, it is possible to use existing vegetation cover, in a more or less modified form, to improve temperature conditions especially in relation to spring frost damage, and to improve water conditions for both plant uptake and plant growth for a variable period depending on the species, but for a minimum of 4 to 5 years. For clearing and thinning, the effects of microclimatic changes created by this type of forestry management, and consequently the response of trees in terms of photosynthesis and growth, are now well defined.},

  abstract = {While foliar photosynthetic relationships with light, nitrogen, and water availability have been well described, environmental factors driving vertical gradients of foliar traits within forest canopies are still not well understood. We, therefore, examined how light availability and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) co-determine vertical gradients (between 12 and 42~m and in the understorey) of foliar photosynthetic capacity (Amax), 13C fractionation (∆), specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll (Chl), and nitrogen (N) concentrations in canopies of Fagus sylvatica and Abies alba growing in a mixed forest in Switzerland in spring and summer 2017. Both species showed lower Chl/N and lower SLA with higher light availability and VPD at the top canopy. Despite these biochemical and morphological acclimations, Amax during summer remained relatively constant and the photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE) decreased with higher light availability for both species, suggesting suboptimal N allocation within the canopy. ∆ of both species were lower at the canopy top compared to the bottom, indicating high water-use efficiency (WUE). VPD gradients strongly co-determined the vertical distribution of Chl, N, and PNUE in F. sylvatica, suggesting stomatal limitation of photosynthesis in the top canopy, whereas these traits were only related to light availability in A. alba. Lower PNUE in F. sylvatica with higher WUE clearly indicated a trade-off in water vs. N use, limiting foliar acclimation to high light and VPD at the top canopy. Species-specific trade-offs in foliar acclimation to environmental canopy gradients may thus be considered for scaling photosynthesis from leaf to canopy to landscape levels.},

At present it is unclear whether errors in canopy-scale and process-level isoprene emission models are due to inadequacies in leaf-to-canopy integration theory or the imperfect assessment of the isoprene-emitting biomass in the flux footprint. To address this issue, an isoprene emission model (CANVEG) was tested over a uniform aspen stand and a mixed-species, broad-leaved forest.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The isoprene emission model consists of coupled micrometeorological and physiological modules. The micrometeorological module computes leaf and soil energy exchange, turbulent diffusion, scalar concentration profiles, and radiative transfer through the canopy. Environmental variables that are computed by the micrometeorological module, in turn, drive physiological modules that calculate leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration and leaf, bole and soil/root respiration, and rates of isoprene emission.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The isoprene emission model accurately predicted the diurnal variation of isoprene emission rates over the boreal aspen stand, as compared with micrometeorological flux measurements. The model’s ability to simulate isoprene emission rates over the mixed temperate forest, on the other hand, depended strongly upon the amount of isoprene-emitting biomass, which, in a mixed-species forest, is a function of the wind direction and the horizontal dimensions of the flux footprint. When information on the spatial distribution of biomass and the flux footprint probability distribution function were included, the CANVEG model produced values of isoprene emission that compared well with micrometeorological measurements. The authors conclude that a mass and energy exchange model, which couples flows of carbon, water, and nutrients, can be a reliable tool for integrating leaf-scale, isoprene emission algorithms to the canopy dimension over dissimilar vegetation types as long as the vegetation is characterized appropriately.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Fluxes of energy and water vapor over boreal forest stands are expected to vary during the growing season due to temporal variations in solar energy, soil and air temperature, soil moisture, photosynthetic capacity, and leaf area. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured fluxes of energy balance components (solar, latent and sensible heat, and soil and canopy heat storage) over and under a boreal jack pine forest in central Canada during the 1994 growing season. Temporal trends of daily-integrated energy fluxes were significant during a 117 day period between spring and autumn. Mean fluxes of net radiation and latent heat peaked near the summer solstice. By the autumnal equinox their magnitudes were half of their peak values. On a day-to-day basis the presence or absence of clouds modulated solar energy fluxes, while evaporation rates were dependent on whether the canopy was dry or wet. When the canopy was dry, daily evaporation was generally less than 2.5 mm d−1. This amount was less than one-half the rate of equilibrium evaporation and was low compared to evaporation from vegetation in temperate zones. When the canopy was wet, daily evaporation approached 3 mm d−1 and exceeded predicted rates of equilibrium evaporation. Evaporation from the dry forest was weakly coupled to available energy and was restricted by the canopy AEs low-surface conductance. Biotic factors limiting the forest AEs surface conductance include the forest AEs low-leaf area index and partial stomatal closure. Abiotic and physiological factors restricting stomatal opening included a scarce supply of soil moisture, limiting vapor pressure deficits and the low photosynthetic capacity of the needles. The fluxes of solar energy and latent and sensible heat at the floor of the forest were a significant portion of energy exchange between the forest and the atmosphere. Typically, 20 to 40\% of the total energy exchange by the jack pine stand originated at the understory. Since a substantial amount of energy occurs under the forest, two-layer, not a big-leaf AE, evaporation models are recommended as a tool for estimating water vapor fluxes from this open forest stand.},

  abstract = {Leaf optical parameters influence light availability at the cellular, leaf, and canopy scale of integration. While recent studies have focused on leaf optical responses to acute plant stress, the effects of changes in plant resources on leaf optics remain poorly characterized. We examined leaf optical and anatomical responses of five temperate deciduous tree species to moderate changes in nutrient and light availability. Spectral reflectance in the visible waveband generally increased at high light, but decreased with increased nutrient availability. Patterns of both spectral reflectance and absorptance were primarily determined by chlorophyll concentration although carotenoid concentration was also influential. While most anatomical features did not explain residual variation in reflectance, cuticle thickness was significantly related to reflectance at complementary angles compared to the angle of incidence. Absorptance did not change with light environment; however, absorption efficiency per unit biomass increased by approximately 40\% under low light, due to reduced leaf mass per area. We conclude that changes in resource availability differentially influence leaf optical properties and that such changes are driven primarily by changes in pigment concentrations. The magnitude of leaf optical responses to moderate changes in resource availability was comparable to those of acute stress responses and varied among species.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as deforestation, forest fires and vegetation thinning among others on net ecosystem—atmosphere exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor and heat—is an important aspect in the context of modeling global carbon, water and energy cycles. The absence of canopy architectural variation in horizontal and vertical directions is a major source of uncertainty in current climate models attempting to address these issues. This manuscript demonstrates the importance of considering the vertical distribution of foliage density by coupling a leaf level plant biophysics model with analytical solutions of wind flow and light attenuation in a horizontally homogeneous canopy. It is demonstrated that plant physiological response in terms of carbon assimilation, transpiration and canopy surface temperature can be widely different for two canopies with the same leaf area index (LAI) but different leaf area density distributions, under several conditions of wind speed, light availability, soil moisture availability and atmospheric evaporative demand.},

In this work large-eddy simulations are used to demonstrate that the CCE appears more generally in canopy turbulence. It is indeed a generic feature of canopy turbulence: \emph{r}\textsubscript{H} of a canopy is found to reduce with increasing unstable stratification, which effectively increases the aerodynamic roughness for the same physical roughness of the canopy. This relation offers a sufficient condition to construct a general description of the CCE. In addition, we review existing parameterizations for \emph{r}\textsubscript{H} from the evapotranspiration literature and test to what extent they are able to capture the CCE, thereby exploring the possibility of an improved parameterization.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Characterization of seasonal dynamics in wind speed attenuation within a plant canopy α is necessary for modeling leaf boundary layer conductance gbV, canopy–atmosphere coupling Ω, and transpiration at multiple scales. The goals of this study were to characterize seasonal variation in α in four tree species with canopy wind profiles and a canopy-structure model, to quantify the impact of α on estimates of gbV and Ω, and to determine the influence of variable wind speed on transpiration estimates from a biophysical model [Multi-Array Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation Assemblage (MAESTRA)]. Among species, α varied significantly with above-canopy wind speed and seasonal canopy development. At the mean above-canopy wind speed (1.5ms–1), α could be predicted using a linear model with leaf area index as the input variable (coefficient of determination R² = 0.78). However, the canopy-structure model yielded improved predictions (R² = 0.92) by including canopy height and leaf width. By midseason, increasing canopy leaf area and α resulted in lower within-canopy wind speeds, a decrease in gbV by 20\%–50\%, and a peak in Ω. Testing a discrete increase in wind speed (0.6–2.4ms–1; seasonal mean plus/minus one standard deviation) had variable influence on transpiration estimates (from –30\% to +20\%), which correlated strongly with vapor pressure deficit (R² = 0.83). Given the importance of α in accurate representation of gbV , Ω, and transpiration, it is concluded that α needs to be given special attention in plant canopies that undergo substantial seasonal changes, especially densely foliated canopies (i.e., leaf area index {$>$}1) and in areas with lower native wind speeds (i.e., {$<$}2ms–1).},

  abstract = {We have characterized overstory light transmission, understory light levels, and plant communities in mixedwood boreal forests of northwestern Quebec with the objective of understanding how overstory light transmission interacts with composition and time since disturbance to influence the diversity and composition of understory vegetation, and, in turn, the further attenuation of light to the forest floor by the understory. Overstory light transmission differed among three forest types (aspen, mixed deciduous–conifer, and old cedar-dominated), with old forests having higher proportions of high light levels than aspen and mixed forests, which were characterized by intermediate light levels. The composition of the understory plant communities in old forests showed the weakest correlation to overstory light transmission, although those forests had the largest range of light transmission. The strongest correlation between characteristics of overstory light transmission and understory communities was found in aspen forests. Species diversity indices were consistently higher in aspen forests but showed weak relationships with overstory light transmission. Light attenuation by the understory vegetation and total height of the understory vegetation were strongly and positively related to overstory light transmission but not forest type. Therefore, light transmission through the overstory influenced the structure and function of understory plants more than their diversity and composition. This is likely due to the strong effect of the upper understory layers, which tend to homogenize light levels at the forest floor regardless of forest type. The understory plant community acts as a filter, thereby reducing light levels at the forest floor to uniformly low levels.},

Long-term drought is, however, also likely to expose understory trees to increased light availability driven by drought-induced mortality. Relatively little is known about the potential for understory trees to adjust their physiology to both decreasing water and increasing light availability. We analysed data on maximum photosynthetic capacity (Jmax, Vcmax), leaf respiration (Rleaf), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf thickness and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from 66 small trees across 12 common genera at the world's longest running tropical rainfall exclusion experiment and compared responses to those from 61 surviving canopy trees. Small trees increased Jmax, Vcmax, Rleaf and LMA (71, 29, 32, 15\% respectively) in response to the drought treatment, but leaf thickness and leaf nutrient concentrations did not change. Small trees were significantly more responsive than large canopy trees to the drought treatment, suggesting greater phenotypic plasticity and resilience to prolonged drought, although differences among taxa were observed. Our results highlight that small tropical trees have greater capacity to respond to ecosystem level changes and have the potential to regenerate resilient forests following future droughts.},

  abstract = {Species composition of temperate forests vary with successional age (i.e., years after a major disturbance) and seems likely to change in response to significant global climate change. Because photosynthesis rates in co-occurring tree species can differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions, these changes in species composition are likely to alter the carbon dynamics of temperate forests. To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere–biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf-level photosynthesis in a 60–70 yr old temperate mixed-deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA). Diurnally and seasonally varying environmental conditions differentially influenced in situ leaf-level photosynthesis rates in the canopies of four mature temperate deciduous tree species: red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). We measured in situ photosynthesis at two heights within the canopies (top of the canopy at ∼20 m, and in the sub-canopy of the same individual trees at ∼14–16 m) through a diurnal time course on 7 d over two growing seasons. We simultaneously measured a suite of environmental conditions surrounding the leaf at the time of each measurement. We used path analysis to examine the influence of environmental factors on in situ photosynthesis in the tree canopies. Overall, red oak had the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by white birch, yellow birch, and red maple. There was little evidence for a substantial midday depression in photosynthesis. Instead, photosynthesis declined throughout the day, particularly after 1600. Diurnal patterns of light reaching canopy leaves, leaf and air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed to diurnally varying photosynthesis rates. Large differences in these parameters through the growing season partly led to the seasonal differences observed in photosynthesis rates. Path analyses helped to identify the relative contribution of various environmental factors on photosynthesis and further revealed that species-specific sensitivities to various environmental conditions shifted through the season. Red oak photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to air temperatures late in the season when air temperatures were low. Further, red maple photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to high VPDs through the growing season. Incorporating data on the physiological differences among tree species into forest carbon models will greatly improve our ability to predict alterations to the forest carbon budgets under various environmental scenarios such as global climate change, or with differing species composition.},

Over the course of two 50\,d continuous periods, growth temperature was controlled within tree crowns and the steady-state rate of leaf gas exchange was measured. Data were then modelled to calculate the influence of genotype variation and vertical distribution of physiological activity on carbon uptake. The maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax), leaf dark respiration rate (Rd), maximum photosynthesis (Amax), and the CO2 compensation point (Γ) increased with temperature during both (i) a constant long-term (50\,d) daytime temperature or (ii) ambient daytime temperature with short-term temperature control (25–38\,°C). In addition, within-crown variation in the temperature response of photosynthesis and Rd was influenced by acclimation to local microclimate temperature gradients. Results indicated that carbon uptake estimates could be overestimated by 22–25\% if the vertical distribution of temperature gradients is disregarded. Temperature is a major factor driving photosynthetic acclimation and within-crown gas exchange variation. Thus, this study established the importance of including spatial acclimation to temperature- and provenance-, ecotype-, and/or genotype-specific parameter sets into carbon uptake models.},

Once validated among Acer rubrum L. genotypes, model responses to different parameterization scenarios were scaled up to stand transpiration (expressed per unit leaf area) to assess how transpiration might be affected by the spatial distribution of foliage properties. For example, when physiological differences were accounted for, differences in leaf width among A. rubrum L. genotypes resulted in a 25\% difference in transpiration. An in silico within-canopy sensitivity analysis was conducted over the range of genotype parameter variation observed and under different climate forcing conditions. The analysis revealed that seven of 16 leaf traits had a ≥5\% impact on transpiration predictions. Under sparse foliage conditions, comparisons of the present findings with previous studies were in agreement that parameters such as the maximum Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis can explain ∼20\% of the variability in predicted transpiration. However, the spatial analysis shows how such parameters can decrease or change in importance below the uppermost canopy layer. Alternatively, model sensitivity to leaf width and minimum stomatal conductance was continuous along a vertical canopy depth profile. Foremost, transpiration sensitivity to an observed range of morphological and physiological parameters is examined and the spatial sensitivity of transpiration model predictions to vertical variations in microclimate and foliage density is identified to reduce the uncertainty of current transpiration predictions.},

  abstract = {Leaves come in a remarkable diversity of sizes and shapes. However, spatial patterns in leaf trait diversity are rarely investigated and poorly resolved. We used a hierarchical approach to evaluate vertical variability in leaf morphology (i.e., leaf trait diversity) in 16 common tree and shrub species inhabiting a New Zealand forest. Height-related heterogeneity in leaf area, specific leaf area, circularity and length to width ratio was analyzed at three scales: (1) among leaves within plants, (2) among plants within species and (3) among species within functional groups (i.e., trees vs. shrubs). Results were scale dependent. Among-leaf morphological diversity was unrelated to plant height. Among-individual morphological diversity increased with the average height of each species, indicating that taller plant species express a greater range of leaf traits than shorter species. Among-species morphological diversity was higher in shrubs than in trees. We hypothesize that scale-dependent patterns in leaf trait diversity result from scale-dependent adaptations to forest environmental conditions. As trees grow from the forest floor into the canopy, they are exposed to a range of environmental conditions, which may select for a range of leaf traits through ontogeny. Conversely, shrubs never reach the forest canopy and may instead be differentially adapted to suites of environmental conditions associated with different stages of forest recovery from tree-fall disturbances. Overall results indicate that vertical patterns in leaf trait diversity exist. However, their strength and directionality are strongly scale-dependent, suggesting that different processes govern leaf shape diversity at different levels of ecological organization.},

  abstract = {Vegetation structure parameters are key elements in the study of ecosystem functioning and global scale ecosystemic interactions. The detailed retrieval of many of these parameters by direct measurements is impractical due to the quantity of plant material in trees. Terrestrial LiDAR Scanners (TLSs) have been shown to hold great potential as an indirect means of estimating plant structure parameters with a high level of detail, while some studies identified a number of challenges inherent to this approach. In this study we investigate the use of a voxel-based approach to retrieve leaf area distribution of individual trees. The approach is based on the contact frequency method applied to co-registered TLS returns from two or more scanning positions. The contact frequency was computed for voxels being 10, 30, and 50cm in size and subsequently corrected for the influence of occlusion effects, leaf inclination, the presence of non-photosynthetic material, and the laser beam size. The leaf area of voxels for which occlusion effects were too pronounced was estimated using modeled values based on the availability of light. We compared the TLS derived leaf area estimates against direct measurements, obtained by the harvesting of leaves, in a broad-leaved savanna of central Mali. The measured leaf area values of the sampled trees ranged from 30 to 530m2, and crown LAI values between 0.8 and 7.2. The leaf area estimates lay on average 14\% from the reference measurements (general bias). Our method provides vertical as well as radial distributions of leaf area in individual trees, and lends itself to the estimation of savanna vegetation structural parameters with a high level of detail.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity informs about biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. The intraspecific component of functional diversity (i.e. the phenotypic space of each species) depicts individual differences in the resource use and fitness among conspecifics, and gives valuable information about the functional similarity (competition) or dissimilarity (complementarity) of coexisting species. Here, we quantified trait differences within tree species along local diversity gradients to shed light on the role that this intraspecific variability exerts on functional complementarity of tree species. We measured architectural traits in 5,036 individuals and leaf traits in 1,403 individuals from nine dominant tree species, surveyed in 92 plots located in three major European forest types (Mediterranean, temperate and boreal forests). In each forest type, plots were positioned along a canopy richness gradient, with every study species present in different species richness levels, including monocultures. Our results showed that the relative magnitude of intraspecific trait variability to community-level variability is high in these forests. At the species level, we found adjustments of species leaf traits (mean shifts) in response to neighbouring trees, suggesting the existence of processes that limit niche overlap. We also found higher variability in architectural traits of conspecific individuals in more diverse canopies, suggesting greater niche packing and a more efficient use of available space as the number of species in the canopy increases. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that differential responses of individuals within a species promote species complementarity, suggesting that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships cannot be properly estimated without accounting for the intraspecific level of functional variation.},

  abstract = {The responses of tropical forests to environmental change are critical uncertainties in predicting the future impacts of climate change. The positive phase of the 2015–2016 El Niño Southern Oscillation resulted in unprecedented heat and low precipitation in the tropics with substantial impacts on the global carbon cycle. The role of African tropical forests is uncertain as their responses to short-term drought and temperature anomalies have yet to be determined using on-the-ground measurements. African tropical forests may be particularly sensitive because they exist in relatively dry conditions compared with Amazonian or Asian forests, or they may be more resistant because of an abundance of drought-adapted species. Here, we report responses of structurally intact old-growth lowland tropical forests inventoried within the African Tropical Rainforest Observatory Network (AfriTRON). We use 100 long-term inventory plots from six countries each measured at least twice prior to and once following the 2015–2016 El Niño event. These plots experienced the highest temperatures and driest conditions on record. The record temperature did not significantly reduce carbon gains from tree growth or significantly increase carbon losses from tree mortality, but the record drought did significantly decrease net carbon uptake. Overall, the long-term biomass increase of these forests was reduced due to the El Niño event, but these plots remained a live biomass carbon sink (0.51 ± 0.40 Mg C ha               −1               y               −1               ) despite extreme environmental conditions. Our analyses, while limited to African tropical forests, suggest they may be more resistant to climatic extremes than Amazonian and Asian forests.},

  abstract = {Climate change is causing a shift in plant species distributions, but the speed at which this happens depends on local conditions. A 2009 Nature paper (go.nature.com/yuz2we) showed that the velocity of climate change is higher in lowland than in highland areas, suggesting that the lag behind climate warming might be greater for lowland species than that for highland species. This suspicion is confirmed in a study of forests distributed across France. A comparison of temperature trends against temperatures reconstructed from thousands of species assemblages across a 44-year period (1965–2008) indicated a temperature lag between the climate and plant community composition in lowland forests that was more than three times that seen in highland forests. This finding has implications for conservation policy. Attention has focused on mountain-top extinctions as a likely consequence of climate warming, but the inertia of forest plant communities suggests that species in lowland forest ecosystems are also at risk.},

  abstract = {Canopy height is an important attribute that allows characterizing the forest vertical structure and analyze changes in vegetation cover over time. The objective of this study is to develop an approach for a spatio-temporal analysis of the tropical forest canopy using multi-temporal photogrammetric images. The datasets based on film and digital cameras are used to generate canopy height models and extract structural variables (tree height, relative variance between tree heights, and density of higher trees in the upper canopy). The combination of these variables is used in the analysis. Each variable is segmented into ordinal categorical classes in its respective dataset with temporal class gradients being obtained between the periods of the multi-temporal datasets. Ex­ periments were conducted in a tropical forest under regeneration and with diversity of tree species in different successional stages. Three sets of images (years 1978, 2010, and 2017) were used for analyzing canopy cover changes. A classification based on histograms of gradient classes indicated and quantified the most frequent behavior of the canopy over time. The results showed that the most significant variations in cover changes could be explained by 13 classes of temporal gradients, which described 88\% of the canopy. This classification was validated with field data collected in sample plots. From the results, it can be concluded that the proposed approach provides accurate assessments of the spatio-temporal canopy cover changes for forest management.},

  abstract = {The energy balance components were measured throughout most of 1994 in and above a southern boreal aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forest (53.629°N 106.200°W) with a hazelnut (Corylus cornuta Marsh.) understory as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. The turbulent fluxes were measured at both levels using the eddy-covariance technique. After rejection of suspect data due to instationarity or inhomogeneity, occasional erratic behavior in turbulent fluxes and lack of energy balance closure led to a recalculation of the fluxes of sensible and latent heat using their ratio and the available energy. The seasonal development in leaf area was reflected in a strong seasonal pattern of the energy balance. Leaf growth began during the third week of May with a maximum forest leaf area index of 5.6 m2 m−2 reached by mid-July. During the full-leaf period, aspen and hazelnut accounted for approximately 40 and 60\% of the forest leaf area, respectively. Sensible heat was the dominant consumer of forest net radiation during the preleaf period, while latent heat accounted for the majority of forest net radiation during the leafed period. Hazelnut transpiration accounted for 25\% of the forest transpiration during the summer months. During the full-leaf period (June 1 to September 7) daytime dry-canopy mean aspen and hazelnut canopy conductances were 330 mmol m−2 s−1 (8.4 mm s−1) (70\% of the total forest conductance) and 113 mmol m−2 s−1 (2.9 mm s−1) (24\% of the total forest conductance), respectively. Maximum aspen and hazelnut canopy conductances were 1200 mmol m−2 s−1 (30 mm s−1) and 910 mmol m−2 s−1 (23 mm s−1 ), respectively, and maximum stomatal conductances were 490 mmol m−2 s−1 (12.5 mm s−1) and 280 mmol m−2 s−1 (7 m s−1), aspen and hazelnut, respectively. Both species showed a decrease in canopy conductance as the saturation deficit increased and both showed an increase in canopy conductance as the photosynthetic active radiation increased. There was a linear relationship between forest leaf area index and forest canopy conductance. The timing, duration, and maximum leaf area of this deciduous boreal forest was found to be an important control on transpiration at both levels of the canopy. The full-leaf hazelnut daytime mean Priestley and Taylor [1972] α coefficient of 1.22 indicated transpiration was largely energy controlled and the quantity of energy received at the hazelnut surface was a function of aspen leaf area. The full-leaf aspen daytime mean α of 0.91 indicated some stomatal control on transpiration, with a directly proportional relationship between forest leaf area and forest canopy conductance, varying α during much of the season through a range very sensitive to regional scale transpiration and surface-convective boundary layer feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Leaf energy balance may influence plant performance and community composition. While biophysical theory can link leaf energy balance to many traits and environment variables, predicting leaf temperature and key driver traits with incomplete parameterizations remains challenging. Predicting thermal offsets (δ, Tleaf − Tair difference) or thermal coupling strengths (β, Tleaf vs. Tair slope) is challenging. We ask: (a) whether environmental gradients predict variation in energy balance traits (absorptance, leaf angle, stomatal distribution, maximum stomatal conductance, leaf area, leaf height); (b) whether commonly measured leaf functional traits (dry matter content, mass per area, nitrogen fraction, δ13C, height above ground) predict energy balance traits; and (c) how traits and environmental variables predict δ and β among species. We address these questions with diurnal measurements of 41 species co-occurring along a 1,100 m elevation gradient spanning desert to alpine biomes. We show that (a) energy balance traits are only weakly associated with environmental gradients and (b) are not well predicted by common functional traits. We also show that (c) δ and β can be partially approximated using interactions among site environment and traits, with a much larger role for environment than traits. The heterogeneity in leaf temperature metrics and energy balance traits challenges larger-scale predictive models of plant performance under environmental change.

  abstract = {Aims Understanding how tree growth is influenced by climate is vital for predicting how forests will respond to climate change, yet there have been few studies of tree growth spanning macroclimatic gradients. The aim of this study is to correlate growth of a single lineage of broadleaf evergreen trees with continental-scale variability in climate. Location Australia's temperate mesic eucalypt forests, spanning latitudes from 23 to 43° S and longitudes from 115 to 153° E. Methods We compiled and analysed a dataset containing around half a million measurements of growth in eucalypt tree diameter, collected from 2409 permanent forestry plots. These plots spanned a range of 558–2105 mm mean annual precipitation and 6–22 °C mean annual temperature. Generalized additive models were used to study the relationship between growth in tree diameter and several temperature and water availability variables. Results Tree growth increased with precipitation, but with a diminishing response above a mean annual precipitation of 1400 mm. There was a peaked response to temperature, with maximum growth occurring at a mean annual temperature of 11 °C and maximum temperature of the warmest month of 25–27 °C. Lower temperatures directly constrain growth. High temperatures primarily reduced growth by reducing water availability, but they also appeared to exert a direct negative effect. Our best model, which included maximum temperature of the warmest month and the ratio of precipitation to evaporation, explained 28\% of the deviance. Main conclusions The productivity of Australia's temperate eucalypt forests could decline substantially as the climate warms, given that 87\% of these forests currently experience a mean annual temperature above 11 °C, where the highest growth rates were observed. This will reduce carbon sequestration and slow recovery after catastrophic disturbances such as wildfire.},

These plants displayed some xeromorphic leaf features, e.g., relatively low stomata density compared with lowland rain forest plants and sun leaves usually with two or more layers of palisade cells. Most species displayed substantial plasticity in leaf structure and chlorophyll concentration in response to different light conditions. Dipterocarp leaves had thinner palisade mesophyll and greater spongy to palisade thickness ratios than non-dipterocarp leaves. The chlorophyll content per unit leaf area of the species studied was within the range quoted for American tropical rainforest trees. Their chlorophyll a : chlorophyll b ratios, however, were much lower than those for forest plants in humid temperate and subtropical regions. This could be attributed to the regular soil water deficits of this forest. Despite large variation in leaf structure and chlorophyll concentration among species and within species on the two distinct conditions, their absorptance of photosynthetic active light was similar. Chlorophyll concentration per unit weight was adversely and nonlinearly related to leaf thickness for the data pooled from all species in both light conditions (R2 = 0.49, P {$<$} 0.001).},

Here we use field data collected across 15 lowland Amazon smallholder properties to examine the relationships between forest structure, mammal diversity, regrowth type, regrowth age, topography and hydrology. Forest structure was quantified together with mammal diversity in 30 paired regrowth-control plots. Forest regrowth stage was classified into three groups: late second-regrowth, early second-regrowth and abandoned pasture. Basal area in regrowth plots remained less than half that recorded in control plots even after 20–25~years. Although basal area did increase in sequence from pasture, early to late-regrowth plots, there was a significant decline in basal area of late-regrowth control plots associated with a decline in the proportion of large trees. Variation in different forest structure responses was explained by contrasting variables, with the proportion of small trees (DBH\,{$<$}\,20~cm) most strongly explained by topography (altitude and slope) whereas the proportion of large trees (DBH\,{$>$}\,60~cm) was explained by plot type (control vs. regrowth) and regrowth class. These findings support calls for increased efforts to actively conserve large trees to avoid retrogressive succession around edges of degraded Amazon forests.},

We implemented in situ leaf-level + 3°C experimental warming from the understory to the upper canopy of two Puerto Rican tropical tree species, Guarea guidonia and Ocotea sintenisii. After approximately 1 month of continuous warming, we assessed adjustments in photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, leaf traits and foliar respiration. Warming did not alter net photosynthetic temperature response for either species; however, the optimum temperature of Ocotea understory leaf photosynthetic electron transport shifted upward. There was no Ocotea respiratory treatment effect, while Guarea respiratory temperature sensitivity (Q10) was down-regulated in heated leaves. The optimum temperatures for photosynthesis (Topt) decreased 3–5°C from understory to the highest canopy position, perhaps due to upper canopy stomatal conductance limitations. Guarea upper canopy Topt was similar to the mean daytime temperatures, while Ocotea canopy leaves often operated above Topt. With minimal acclimation to warmer temperatures in the upper canopy, further warming could put these forests at risk of reduced CO2 uptake, which could weaken the overall carbon sink strength of this tropical forest.},

We implemented in-situ leaf-level warming along a vertical gradient within a mature forest canopy to investigate photosynthetic acclimation potential of two northern hardwood species, Acer saccharum and Tilia americana. After seven days of +3 °C warming, photosynthetic acclimation was assessed by measuring differences between heated and control photosynthetic rates (Aopt) at leaf optimum temperatures (Topt). We also measured the effects of warming and height on maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and leaf traits: leaf area, leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, and leaf water content. We found no evidence of photosynthetic acclimation for either species, but rather Aopt declined with warming overall. We found slight shifts in LMA and Narea, leaf traits associated with photosynthetic capacity, after one week of experimental warming. T. americana LMA and Narea was lower in the upper canopy heated leaves than in the control leaves, contributing a shift in Narea height distribution in the heated leaves. T. americana showed evidence of greater resiliency to warming, with greater thermoregulation, physiological plasticity, and evapotranspiration. As expected, Aopt of A. saccharum increased with height, but Aopt of T. americana was highest in the sub canopy, possibly due to constraints on leaf water balance and photosynthetic capacity in the upper canopy. Thus, models relying on canopy height or light environment may incorrectly estimate vertical variation of photosynthetic capacity. If these species are not able to acclimate to warmer temperatures, we could see alteration of plant carbon balance of these two key northern hardwood species.},

The low red/far-red ratios of shade light reduce phytochrome B activity, which allows PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) to directly activate the transcription of auxin-synthesis genes, leading to shade-avoidance responses. Direct PIF interaction with DELLA proteins links gibberellin and brassinosteroid signaling to shade avoidance. Shade avoidance also requires CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (COP1), a target of cryptochromes, phytochromes, and UVR8.

  abstract = {1. Canopy plasticity, the expression of different leaf phenotypes within the crown of an individual tree has complex functional and evolutionary implications that remain to be thoroughly assessed. We hypothesized that it can lead to disparity in how leaves in different positions of the canopy change with allometric growth and population genetic structure. 2. Leaf phenotypes of the inner and outer canopy were estimated using eight morphological and physiological characters. All traits were measured under field conditions in six populations of Olea europaea and again in a common garden for a subset of the genotypes. The same populations were characterized genetically with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) genomic scans. With these data, we investigated the extent to which leaf phenotypes change with plant size, genetic processes and in response to environmental conditions inside and outside the canopy. 3. The size of trees measured in the field was clearly associated with the phenotype of sun but not to that of shade leaves. The phenotype of sun leaves depended on both direct and diffuse light, while that of shade leaves was found to correlate only with diffuse radiation. Additionally, light availability inside the canopy was conditioned by the shape of external leaves, and increasing elongation of sun leaves led to higher radiation in the inner canopy. 4. The field phenotypes of both inner and outer canopy leaves were correlated with genetic variation among populations. Conversely, in the common garden, the different genotypes expressed a homogeneous sun phenotype, while phenotypic differences among populations remained apparent in shade leaves. 5. We conclude that, in agreement with our working hypothesis, canopy plasticity is both cause and consequence of the environment experienced by the plant and might lead to the differential expression of genetic polymorphisms among leaves.

Although vertical LMA gradients in forests have historically been attributed to a direct phenotypic response to light, an increasing number of recent studies have provided evidence that water limitation in the upper canopy can constrain foliar morphological adaptations to higher light levels. We measured height, light, and LMA of all species encountered along 45 vertical canopy transects across a Costa Rican tropical rain forest. LMA was correlated with light levels in the lower canopy until approximately 18 m sample height and 22\% diffuse transmittance. Height showed a remarkably linear relationship with LMA throughout the entire vertical canopy profile for all species pooled and for each functional group individually (except epiphytes), possibly through the influence of gravity on leaf water potential and turgor pressure. Models of forest function may be greatly simplified by estimating LMA-correlated leaf physiological parameters solely from foliage height profiles, which in turn can be assessed with satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing.},

The habitats investigated were a 0.5 ha clearing, a 400 m2 gap, a 200 m2 gap, and heavily shaded understorey. (2) Measurements were made during both wet and dry seasons under a variety of weather conditions. Quantum sensors were used to monitor continuously 10-min average PPFD over a 3-10 day period at each location. Daily average PPFD, total daily PPFD, and daily frequency distributions were analysed for two adjacent sensors per site on each sampling day. (3) Daily total PPFD in the understorey, 200 m2 gap, and 400 m2 gap were 1-2\%, 9\%, and 20-35\%, respectively, of PPFD in the clearing. Daily total PPFD in the 400 m2 gap during the dry season was, on average, 2.4 times greater than in the 200 m2 gap, and 20-25 times those in the understorey. In the 200 m2 gap, daily total PPFD was nine times greater than in the understorey during the dry season. (4) In the clearing, PPFD was significantly different between seasons with 24\% higher PPFD during the dry season. In the 400 m2 gap and understorey, PPFD was not significantly different between seasons. (5) The percentage of available PPFD reaching the understorey was highest on cloudy, overcast days and lowest on sunny days. No correlation was found between daily total PPFD in the 400 m2 gap centre and in the adjacent understorey measured on the same days. (6) In the clearing, a high proportion of 10-min averages were greater than 500 μ mol m-2 s-1; in the 400 m2 gap, a high proportion of 10-min averages were between 100 μ mol m-2 s-1 and 500 μ mol m-2 s-1; in the understorey over 70\% of the 10-min averages were below 10 μ mol m-2 s-1. The clearing exhibited the greatest diurnal variation in PPFD and the least day-to-day variation, whereas the understorey exhibited the least diurnal variation and the greatest day-to-day variation in PPFD.},

Leaf photosynthesis, morphology and chemistry in the upper and lower canopy positions of Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc and Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Turoz in broadleaved Korean pine forest were determined in September 2009. Canopy position did not significantly affect light-saturated photosynthetic rate based on unit area (Parea) and unit dry mass (Pmass), apparent quantum yield (α), light compensation point (LCP), light saturation point (LSP); total nitrogen (Nm), phosphorus (Pm), carbon (Cm), and chlorophyll content (Chlm) per unit dry mass; leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) for P. koraiensis current-year needles and Q. mongolica leaves. While in P. koraiensis one-year-old needles, Parea, Pmass, α and LCP in the upper canopy were lower than those in the lower canopy. The needles of P. koraiensis had higher Cm and LMA than leaves of Q. mongolica, but Pmass, Chlm and PNUE showed opposite trend. There were no differences in Parea, LSP, Nm, and Pm between the two species. Needle age significantly influenced photosynthetic parameters, chemistry and LMA of P. koraiensis needles except LCP, LSP and Cm. In contrast to LMA, Parea, Pmass, Nm, Pm, Chlm, and PNUE of one-year-old needles were significantly lower than those of current-year needles for P. koraiensis. The negative correlations between LMA and Pmass, Nm, Pm, Chlm, and positive correlations between Pmass and Nm, Pm, Chlm were found for P. koraiensis current-year needles and Q. mongolica leaves. Our results indicate that leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents and nutrient absorption from soil are similar for mature P. koraiensis and Q. mongolica growing in the same environment, while difference in carbon content between P. koraiensis and Q. mongolica may be attributed to inherent growth characteristics.},

Although LES is well established for traits of sun leaves, it is unclear how well LES characterizes the diversity of traits for shade leaves. Here, we evaluate LES using the sun and shade leaves of 75 woody species sampled at the extremes of a within-canopy light gradient in a subtropical forest. Shading significantly decreased the mean values of LMA and the rates of photosynthesis and dark respiration, but had no discernable effect on nitrogen and phosphorus content. Sun and shade leaves manifested the same relationships among Nmass, Pmass, Amass, and Rmass (i.e., the slopes of log–log scaling relations of LES traits did not differ between sun and shade leaves). However, the difference between the scaling constants of shade and sun leaves was correlated with functional trait plasticity. Although the generality of this finding should be evaluated further using larger datasets comprising more phylogenetically diverse taxa and biomes, these findings support a unified LES across shade as well as sun leaves.},

  abstract = {Premise of the study Leaves are the sites of greatest water stress in trees and a key means of acclimation to the environment. We considered phenotypic plasticity of Pseudotsuga menziesii leaves in their ecological context, exploring responsiveness to natural gradients in water stress (indicated by sample height) and light availability (measured from hemispherical photos) to understand how leaf structure is controlled by abiotic factors in tall tree crowns. Methods After measuring anatomy, morphology, and carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of leaves throughout crowns of P. menziesii {$>$}90 m tall, we compared structural plasticity of leaves among the three tallest conifer species using equivalent data from past work on Sequoia sempervirens and Picea sitchensis. Key results Leaf mass per projected area (LMA) and δ13C increased and mesoporosity (airspace/area) decreased along the water-stress gradient, while light did not play a detectable role in leaf development. Overall, leaves of P. menziesii were far less phenotypically responsive to within-crown abiotic gradients than either P. sitchensis, whose leaves responded strongly to light availability, or S. sempervirens, whose leaves responded equally strongly to water stress. Conclusions P. menziesii maintain remarkably consistent leaf structure despite pronounced vertical gradients in abiotic factors. Contrasting patterns of leaf structural plasticity underlie divergent ecological strategies of the three tallest conifer species, which coexist in Californian rainforests.},

  abstract = {As main photosynthetic organs, leaves are very sensitive to exterior environments. Water deficiency obviously affects the biological and physiological characteristics of leaves. Xylem pathways increase when trees grow tall, which results in the increase in water gravity as well as pathway resistance. Accordingly, the physiological characteristics of leaves change along with tree height. In this research, the photosynthetic characteristics and carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) in the leaves of 4 tree species, Platanus hispanica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Fraxinus chinensis and Ginkgo biloba, were measured. The results showed that the leaf photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Cond) and internal CO2 concentration (Ci) reduced along with tree height, while the leaf δ13C increased along with tree height. The One Way ANOVA and LSD tests showed that the leaf photosynthetic characteristics and δ13C varied significantly at different tree heights (P {$<$} 0.05). The decrease in leaf photosynthetic capability and the increase in δ13C along with tree height indicate that the leaves at the tree tops suffer from water stress. These results support the hydraulic limitation hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Increased atmospheric [CO2] could theoretically lead to increased forest productivity (‘CO2 fertilization’). This mechanism was hypothesized as a possible explanation for biomass increases reported from tropical forests in the last 30+ years. We used unique long-term records of annually measured stands (eighteen 0.5 ha plots, 10 years) and focal tree species (six species, 24 years) to assess the effects of rainfall, temperature, and atmospheric [CO2] on annual wood production in a neotropical rain forest. Our study area was a meso-scale section (600 ha) of old-growth Tropical Wet Forest in NE Costa Rica. Using the repeated remeasurements we directly assessed the relative effects of interannual climatic variation and increasing atmospheric [CO2] on wood production. A remarkably simple two-factor model explained 91\% of the interannual variance in stand-level tree growth; the statistically independent factors were total dry season rainfall (positive effect, r2=0.85) and night-time temperature (negative effect, r2=0.42). Stand-level tree mortality increased significantly with night-time temperature. After accounting for dry season rainfall and night-time temperature, there was no effect of annual [CO2] on tree growth in either the stand or focal species data. Tree growth in this Tropical Wet Forest was surprisingly sensitive to the current range of dry season conditions and to variations in mean annual night-time temperature of 1–2°. Our results suggest that wood production in the lowland rainforests of NE Costa Rica (and by extension in other tropical regions) may be severely reduced in future climates that are only slightly drier and/or warmer.},

The trees' annual diameter increments in this 16-yr period were negatively correlated with annual means of daily minimum temperatures. The tree growth variations also negatively covaried with the net carbon exchange of the terrestrial tropics as a whole, as inferred from nearly pole-to-pole measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) interpreted by an inverse tracer–transport model. Strong reductions in tree growth and large inferred tropical releases of CO2 to the atmosphere occurred during the record-hot 1997–1998 El Niño. These and other recent findings are consistent with decreased net primary production in tropical forests in the warmer years of the last two decades. As has been projected by recent process model studies, such a sensitivity of tropical forest productivity to on-going climate change would accelerate the rate of atmospheric CO2 accumulation.},

We established a series of 9 1-ha plots in old-growth tropical rainforest in Costa Rica along a 2700 m relief elevational gradient to carry out long-term monitoring of tropical rain forest structure, dynamics and tree growth. Within each plot we mapped, identified, and annually measured diameter for all woody individuals with stem diameters {$>$}10 cm for periods of 3-10 years. Wood species diversity peaked at 400-600 m and decreased substantially at higher elevations. Basal area and stem number varied by less than two-fold, with the exception of the 2800 m cloud forest summit, where basal area and stem number were approximately double that of lower sites. Canopy gaps extending to the forest floor accounted for {$<$}3\% of microsites at all elevations. Height of highest crowns and the coefficient of variation of crown height both decreased with increasing elevation. Rates of turnover of individuals and of stand basal area decreased with elevation, but rates of diameter growth and stand basal area showed no simple relation to elevation. We discuss issues encountered in the design and implementation of this network of plots, including biased sampling, missing key meteorological and biomass data, and strategies for improving species-level research. Taking full advantage of the major research potential of tropical forest elevational transects will require sustaining and extending ground based studies, incorporation of new remotely-sensed data and data-acquisition platforms, and new funding models to support decadal research on these rapidly-changing systems.},

Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrostatic constraints on leaf morphology drive the vertical increase in LMA with height early in the growing season; however, LMA in the upper canopy continued to increase over time during light acclimation, indicating that light is primarily driving gradients in LMA later in the growing season. Models with no seasonal variation in Narea overestimated Ac by up to 11\% early in the growing season, while models with no vertical variation in Narea overestimated Ac by up to 60\% throughout the season.

  abstract = {Within-canopy gradients of leaf functional traits have been linked to both light availability and vertical gradients in leaf water potential. While observational studies can reveal patterns in leaf traits, within-canopy experimental manipulations can provide mechanistic insight to tease apart multiple interacting drivers. Our objectives were to disentangle effects of height and light environment on leaf functional traits by experimentally shading branches along vertical gradients within a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest. Shading reduced leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea), and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and increased mass-based leaf nitrogen (Nmass), highlighting the importance of light availability on leaf morphology and chemistry. Early in the growing season, midday leaf water potential (ψmid) LMA, and Narea were driven primarily by height; later in the growing season, light became the most important driver for LMA and Narea. Carbon isotope composition (δ¹³C) displayed strong, linear correlations with height throughout the growing season, but did not change with shading, implying that height is more influential than light on water use efficiency and stomatal behavior. LMA, leaf density, Nmass, C:N ratio, and δ¹³C all changed seasonally, suggesting that leaf ageing effects on leaf functional traits are equally as important as microclimatic conditions. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit or ψmid constrains the supply of CO₂ to leaves at higher heights, independent of light environment, and (2) LMA and Narea distributions become functionally optimized through morphological acclimation to light with increasing leafage despite height-related constraints.},

  abstract = {Deciduousness is an important functional attribute of tropical trees, reflecting climatic conditions. Precisely quantifying and mapping deciduousness in tropical forests will be necessary for calibrating remote sensing images which attempt to assess canopy properties such as carbon cycling, productivity, or chlorophyll content. We thus set out to assess the degree of canopy deciduousness in three moist, semi-deciduous tropical forests in central Panama. One site is a 6-ha research plot near the Atlantic coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2830 mm/yr. The second site is a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, near the center of the isthmus of Panama, where rainfall is 2570 mm/yr, and the final site is a 4-ha plot near the Pacific coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2060 mm/yr. At each site, a random sample of trees from all canopy species (those with individuals ≥ 30 cm DBH) were visited and scored for deciduousness three times during the 1997 dry season. The estimated peak fraction of deciduous individuals in the canopy at the wetter site was 4.8\%, at the intermediate site, 6.3\%, and at the drier site, 24.3\%. The estimated fraction of crown area deciduous peaked at 3.6\%, 9.7\%, and 19.1\% at the wet, medium, and dry sites respectively. The percentage of canopy species that was deciduous – 14\%, 28\%, and 41\% – was much higher than the percentage of deciduous individuals, because not all individuals of deciduous species were deciduous. During the 1999 dry season, every individual of all the deciduous species was visited at the two drier sites, and the total number of deciduous trees observed closely matched the estimated numbers based on the smaller 1997 samples.},

Australian rainforests extend over 33° of latitude, providing an opportunity to compare temperature responses of temperate and tropical species. • Net photosynthesis was measured in leaves developed under a constant (22°C : 14°C) or fluctuating (17°C : 9°C−27°C : 19°C) day/night temperature regime. These leaves were then subjected to a series of constant temperature regimes and net photosynthesis was measured 14 d after acclimation to each new regime. • Acclimation potential was not affected by the contrasting temperature regimes. The temperate species showed at least 80\% of maximum net photosynthesis over a larger span of acclimation temperature than the tropical species. • The lack of an effect of the contrasting temperature regimes on acclimation potential may reflect either that adjustments were unnecessary for temperate species, which already have broad photosynthetic responses to temperature, and tropical species were incapable of adjustments, or that in general species respond to the mean temperature regime and not to the amount of fluctuation in the regime.

  abstract = {Tree crowns are spatially heterogeneous, sometimes resulting in significant variation in microclimate across the canopy, particularly with respect to temperature. Yet it is not known whether such localised temperature variation equates to intracanopy variation in leaf-level physiological thermal tolerance. Here, we studied whether microclimate variation across the canopy of a dominant desert tree equated to localised variation in leaf thermal thresholds (T50) among four canopy positions: upper south, upper north, lower south, lower north. Principal component analysis was used to generate a composite climatic stress variable (CSTRESS) from canopy temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and relative humidity. We also determined the average number of days that maximum temperatures exceeded the air temperature equating to this species’ critical threshold of 49 °C (­ AT49). To estimate how closely leaf temperatures track ambient temperature, we predicted the thermal time constant (τ) for leaves at each canopy position. We found that CSTRESS and ­AT49 were significantly greater in lower and north-facing positions in the canopy. Differences in wind speed with height resulted in significantly longer predicted τ for leaves positioned at lower, north-facing positions. Variation in these drivers was correlated with significantly higher T50 for leaves in these more environmentally stressful canopy positions. Our findings suggest that this species may optimise resources to protect against thermal damage at a whole-plant level. They also indicate that, particularly in desert environments with steep intracanopy microclimatic gradients, whole-plant carbon models could substantially under- or overestimate productivity under heat stress, depending on where in the canopy T50 is measured.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of leaf traits that protect against critically high leaf temperatures, relationships among such traits have not been investigated. Further, while some leaf trait relationships are well documented across biomes, little is known about such associations within a biome. This study investigated relationships between nine leaf traits that protect leaves against excessively high temperatures in 95 Australian arid zone species. Seven morphological traits were measured: leaf area, length, width, thickness, leaf mass per area, water content, and an inverse measure of pendulousness. Two spectral properties were measured: reflectance of visible and near-infrared radiation. Three key findings emerged: (1) leaf pendulousness increased with leaf size and leaf mass per area, the former relationship suggesting that pendulousness affords thermal protection when leaves are large; (2) leaf mass per area increased with thickness and decreased with water content, indicating alternative means for protection through increasing thermal mass; (3) spectral reflectance increased with leaf mass per area and thickness and decreased with water content. The consistent co-variation of thermal protective traits with leaf mass per area, a trait not usually associated with thermal protection, suggests that these traits fall along the leaf economics spectrum, with leaf longevity increasing through protection not only against structural damage but also against heat stress.},

Narea decreased with decreasing \%PAR in each stand, in all conifer stands combined (r=0.52) and in all stands combined (r=0.46). Understory alder had higher Narea for similar \%PAR than did aspen early in the growing season. Amax decreased with decreasing Narea, except for the negative correlation between Narea and Amax during shoot flush for jack pine. For the middle and late growing season data, Narea and Amax had r values of 0.51 for all stands combined and 0.60 for all conifer stands combined. For similar Narea the aspen stand had higher Amax than did the conifer stands. Photosynthetic capacity expressed as a percentage of Amax at the top of the canopy (\%Amax0) decreased with \%PAR similarly in all stands, but \%Amax0 decreased at a much slower rate than did \%PAR. To demonstrate the implications of the vertical distribution of Amax, three different assumptions were used to scale leaf Amax to the canopy (Acan-max): (1) constant Amax with canopy depth, (2)Amax scaled proportionally to \%PAR, and (3) a linear relationship between Amax and cumulative leaf area index derived from our data. The first and third methods resulted in similar Acan-max; the second was much lower. All methods resulted in linear correlations between normalized difference vegetation indices measured from a helicopter and Acan-max (r=0.97, 0.93, and 0.97, respectively), but the slope was strongly influenced by the scaling method.},

Wind speed attenuation within the tree crown was strongly correlated to the cumulative leaf area along the wind path into the crown, as deduced from the 3D distribution of the tree foliage, obtained by the combined use of digitizing and allometric relationships. Simulations by the RATP model, i.e., a 3D numerical model of radiation transfer, leaf transpiration and photosynthesis (Sinoquet et al., 1999), were used (i) to study the spatial variations of transpiration, photosynthesis and leaf-to-atmosphere coupling within the tree crown; and (ii) to analyse coupling at tree level, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of total transpiration to climate variations. The main results of the simulations were: (i) spatial variations of stomatal conductance were mainly responsible for the important spatial variation of the leaf-to-air decoupling factor (Ω) within the tree crown; (ii) high coupling was observed at tree level, so that whole tree transpiration was primarily controlled by air VPD and secondarily by radiation; (iii) wind velocity and direction influenced only weakly the local transpiration, and had no effect on photosynthetic rates.},

LMA decreases exponentially within the canopy at a lower rate coefficient (kLMA) than the extinction coefficient (kPAR) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); consequently the canopy is not fully optimized for the carbon balance. A new algorithm to simulate LMA in forest canopies is developed. The algorithm is based on a relationship between LMA of leaves at a given canopy depth and PAR, that they absorb, during leaf growth. The LMA sub-model is then tested against independent experimental data to demonstrate its validity to assess (i) the LMA vertical distribution inside the canopy, (ii) its evolution during the season and (iii) the variability observed between sites, years and species. Then, the LMA sub-model is coupled with a process-based model simulating carbon, water and energy balances in forest ecosystem. The coupled model is applied to a sensitive analysis for a case study in a beech forest.},

  abstract = {Forest canopies buffer climate extremes and promote microclimates that may function as refugia for understory species under changing climate. However, the biophysical conditions that promote and maintain microclimatic buffering and its stability through time are largely unresolved. We posited that forest microclimatic buffering is sensitive to local water balance and canopy cover, and we measured this effect during the growing season across a climate gradient in forests of the northwestern United States (US). We found that forest canopies buffer extremes of maximum temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), with biologically meaningful effect sizes. For example, during the growing season, maximum temperature and VPD under at least 50\% forest canopy were 5.3°C and 1.1 kPa lower on average, respectively, compared to areas without canopy cover. Canopy buffering of temperature and vapor pressure deficit was greater at higher levels of canopy cover, and varied with water balance, implying that buffering effects are subject to changes in local hydrology. We project changes in the water balance for the mid-21st century and predict how such changes may impact the ability of western US forests to buffer climate extremes. Our results suggest that some forests will lose their capacity to buffer climate extremes as sites become increasingly water limited. Changes in water balance combined with accelerating canopy losses due to increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance will create potentially non-linear changes in the microclimate conditions of western US forests.},

We show that forests function as a thermal insulator, cooling the understory when ambient temperatures are hot and warming the understory when ambient temperatures are cold. The understory versus open temperature offset is magnified as temperatures become more extreme and is of greater magnitude than the warming of land temperatures over the past century. Tree canopies may thus reduce the severity of warming impacts on forest biodiversity and functioning.},

Consistently higher levels of the reversible component of NPQ as well as higher degrees of rapidly attainable de-epoxida-tion of the xanthophyll cycle (VAZ) pool were observed in sun leaves compared to deep shade leaves. It is concluded that these altered features of the xanthophyll cycle allowed sun leaves to dissipate excess energy more effectively over the short term. In addition to the rapid increase in reversible NPQ, shade leaves exhibited a slow further, and sustained, increase in NPQ. In contrast to these deep shade leaves experimentally exposed to high PFDs, understory leaves experiencing highly variable PFD in their natural environment appeared to be able to dissipate excess excitation energy adequately via xanthophyll cycle-dependent thermal dissipation. Furthermore, very consistent trends across plant species were observed for changes in carotenoid composition (pools of carotenes, VAZ, and other xantho-phylls) in response to light environment, as long as it is assumed that in some species rβ-carotene can be replaced by α-carotene and in a few plant species lutein can be replaced by lactucaxanthin. Sun leaves consistently exhibited much greater levels of VAZ than shade leaves but very similar levels of lutein and neoxanthin (all on a Chi basis) as well as an only slightly higher ratio of total carotenes to the pool of all xanthophylls.},

However, whether the trait co-ordination observed at the global scale occurs at other ecological scales (especially within species) remains an open question. Here, for sapling communities of two tropical dry forest types in Costa Rica, we show large differences amongst traits in the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variation to their directional changes in response to environmental changes along a successional gradient. We studied the response of functional traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum and drought tolerance using intensive sampling to analyse inter- and intra-specific responses to environmental changes and ontogeny. Although the overall functional composition of the sapling communities changed during succession more through species turnover than through intraspecific trait variation, their relative contributions differed greatly amongst traits. For instance, community mean specific leaf area changed mostly due to intraspecific variation. Traits of the leaf economics spectrum showed decoupled responses to environmental drivers and ontogeny. These findings emphasise how divergent ecological mechanisms combine to cause great differences in changes of individual functional traits over environmental gradients and ecological scales.},

However, it is widely observed that N-a declines less rapidly than light in real plant canopies. Here we show that this general observation can be explained by optimal leaf acclimation to light subject to a lower-bound constraint on the leaf mass per area (m(a)). Using a simple model of the carbon-nitrogen (C-N) balance of trees with a steady-state canopy, we implement this constraint within the framework of the MAXX optimization hypothesis that maximizes net canopy C export. Virtually all canopy traits predicted by MAXX (leaf N gradient, leaf N concentration, leaf photosynthetic capacity, canopy N content, leaf-area index) are in close agreement with the values observed in a mature stand of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies L. Karst.). An alternative upper-bound constraint on leaf photosynthetic capacity (A(sat)) does not reproduce the canopy traits of this stand. MAXX subject to a lower bound on m(a) is also qualitatively consistent with co-variations in leaf N gradient, m(a) and A(sat) observed across a range of temperate and tropical tree species. Our study highlights the key role of constraints in optimization models of plant function.},

  abstract = {In tropical montane forests, the wetness of leaf surfaces is an important parameter which may influence gas exchange, growth and vitality of leaves, and forest productivity. Thirty surface wetness sensors were operated during May–August 2004 in a vertical profile inside an old-growth lower montane rain forest of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, with the objective to analyse spatial and temporal patterns of surface wetness and to relate wetness duration to the microclimate inside the stand. The canopy was wet during 25–30\% of time in this study period. In a dry period, however, surface wetness lasted for only 5\% of the time, whereas the canopy was wet during 45–55\% of the time in a rainy period. In the lower shade canopy, surface wetness continuously existed for periods of up to 22h and more, although rainfall occurred only during afternoon thunderstorms of limited duration. The long duration of surface wetness has implications for forest interception models, which assume a complete drying of the canopy between subsequent rainfall events. In periods with rainfall, leaf wetness typically occurred in the afternoon, evening and first half of the night because intercepted water persisted on the leaves until about midnight. In dry periods, in contrast, surface wetness was mainly caused by dewfall in the second half of the night, and it occurred mainly in the uppermost canopy where radiative heat losses resulted in a substantial under-cooling of the leaves. Ecophysiological and hydrological importance is suggested by the long duration of surface wetting in this stand with possible implications for gas exchange, leaf growth, leaf colonization by epiphylls and the forest water balance.},

  abstract = {Independent verification of anthropogenic influence on specific extreme climate events remains elusive. This study presents a framework for such verification. This framework reveals that previously published results based on a 1961–2005 attribution period frequently underestimate the influence of global warming on the probability of unprecedented extremes during the 2006–2017 period. This underestimation is particularly pronounced for hot and wet events, with greater uncertainty for dry events. The underestimation is reflected in discrepancies between probabilities predicted during the attribution period and frequencies observed during the out-of-sample verification period. These discrepancies are most explained by increases in climate forcing between the attribution and verification periods, suggesting that 21st-century global warming has substantially increased the probability of unprecedented hot and wet events. Hence, the use of temporally lagged periods for attribution—and, more broadly, for extreme event probability quantification—can cause underestimation of historical impacts, and current and future risks.

  abstract = {Canopy phenology of Acacia tortilis ssp. raddiana, a dominant semi-deciduous species of the northern Sahelian zone, was monitored for 39 mature individuals, each month and bi-weekly in the rainy season, over a 5.5-year period in North Senegal. To investigate the relationships between leaf phenology and environmental variables, soil water availability and several climatic variables were monitored. Over six rainy seasons, annual rainfall ranged between 146 and 367mm. The full canopy stage lasted between 5 and 8 months, broadly including the rainy season (July–September) and the “cool” dry season (November–January). A significant inter-annual variation, up to 2.0 months, affects both the timing of the peaks of leaf flush and leaf fall. The canopy was maintained during the dry season despite low upper soil water availability and tree roots had access to a deep water table (31m). These results support the current view that in the dry tropics, groundwater availability is the major environmental variable controlling leaf phenology. However, inter-annual variation in the peaks of leaf flush and leaf fall could not be explained by ground water, genetics or day length. In such water-controlled biome, we focused on a comparison between two additional drivers, upper soil water availability and climatic variables which contribute to evaporative demand. Models predicting changes in canopy fullness from environmental variables were investigated by polynomial logistic regression. We considered each tree and pooled all the years, distinguishing periods of leaf flush (April–August) and leaf fall (January–April). Then, the ability of such models to predict inter-annual variation in the timing of peaks of leaf flush and leaf fall was tested. Inter-annual variation in the timing of leaf flush peak was well predicted by models based on air relative humidity or vapour pressure deficit or global radiation (root mean square error=0.5 month and R2=0.8). Inter-annual variation of leaf fall peak was also significantly predicted by models based on atmospheric variables (temperatures or maximum value of vapour pressure deficit) however with weaker relationships (root mean square error=0.7 month and R2=0.7). By contrast, models based on upper soil water availability or rainfall did not predict either leaf flush or leaf fall inter-annual variation. It appears that inter-annual variation of canopy phenology is mainly tuned to atmospheric conditions. Such behaviour maximizes the duration of high photosynthetic activity below a threshold of evaporative demand.},

We encourage consideration of the leaf- and canopy-to-air temperature difference (ΔΤ) as a benchmark for land-surface modelling and an important feature of plant and ecosystem function. Location Tropical SW China. Time period 2013. Major Taxa studies Tropical trees. Methods We illustrate diurnal cycles of leaf- and canopy-to-air temperature difference (ΔΤ) with field measurements in a tropical dry woodland and with continuous monitoring data in a tropical seasonal forest. The Priestley–Taylor (PT) and Penman–Monteith (PM) approaches to evapotranspiration are used to provide insights into the interpretation and prediction of ΔT. Field measurements are also compared with land-surface model results obtained with the Joint U.K. Land Environment Simulator (JULES) set up for the conditions of the site. Results The ΔT followed a consistent diurnal cycle, with negative values at night (attributable to negative net radiation) becoming positive in the morning, reaching a plateau and becoming negative again when air temperature exceeded a ‘crossover’ in the 24–29 °C range. Daily time courses of ΔT could be approximated by either the PT or the PM model, but JULES tended to underestimate the magnitude of negative ΔT. Main conclusions Leaves with adequate water supply are partly buffered against air-temperature variations, through a passive biophysical mechanism. This is likely to be important for optimal leaf function, and land-surface and vegetation models should aim to reproduce it.},

  abstract = {We used leaf gas exchange, sap flow, and eddy covariance measurements to investigate whether high temperature substantially limits CO2 uptake at the LBA-ECO (Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere) km-83 tropical forest site in Brazil. Leaf-level temperature-photosynthesis curves, and comparisons of whole-canopy net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) with air temperature, showed that CO2 uptake declined sharply during warm periods. Observations of ambient leaf microclimate showed that leaves oscillate between two states: a cool, dimly lit stage and a hot, brightly illuminated stage where leaf temperatures are often greater than 35°C. The leaf-level rates of photosynthesis decreased when shaded leaves (∼ambient air temperature and {$<$} 500 μmol m−2 s−1) were transferred into a prewarmed, brightly illuminated chamber (35° to 38°C and 1000 μmol m−2 s−1), coincident with increased leaf temperature, increased evaporative demand, and stomatal closure. The rates of whole-canopy CO2 uptake calculated at 5-min intervals increased initially at the onset of sunny periods that followed extended cloudy periods, but then decreased as the sunlight continued, leaf temperature and evaporative demand increased, and canopy conductance decreased. The forest at km-83 appears to be close to a high temperature threshold, above which CO2 uptake drops sharply. This sensitivity results in part from the covariance between leaf temperature and leaf illumination; the brightly illuminated leaves that contribute disproportionately to canopy photosynthesis are warmed to the point that leaf gas exchange is curtailed.},

Here, we measure leaf traits and leaf albedo at ten 1-ha plots along a 3,200-m elevation gradient in Peru. Leaf mass per area (LMA) decreased with warmer temperatures along the elevation gradient; the distribution of LMA was positively skewed at all sites indicating a shift in LMA towards a warmer climate and future reduced tropical LMA. Reduced LMA was significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.0001) correlated with reduced leaf near-infrared (NIR) albedo; community-weighted mean NIR albedo significantly (P\,{$<$}\,0.01) decreased as temperature increased. A potential future 2\,°C increase in tropical temperatures could reduce lowland tropical leaf LMA by 6–7\,g\,m−2 (5–6\%) and reduce leaf NIR albedo by 0.0015–0.002\,units. Reduced NIR albedo means that leaves are darker and absorb more of the Sun’s energy. Climate simulations indicate this increased absorbed energy will warm tropical forests more at high CO2 conditions with proportionately more energy going towards heating and less towards evapotranspiration and cloud formation.},

  abstract = {Thermoregulation of leaf temperature (Tleaf) may foster metabolic homeostasis in plants, but the degree to which Tleaf is moderated, and under what environmental contexts, is a topic of debate. Isotopic studies inferred the temperature of photosynthetic carbon assimilation to be a constant value of c. 20°C; by contrast, leaf biophysical theory suggests a strong dependence of Tleaf on environmental drivers. Can this apparent disparity be reconciled? We continuously measured Tleaf and whole-crown net CO2 uptake for Eucalyptus parramattensis trees growing in field conditions in whole-tree chambers under ambient and +3°C warming conditions, and calculated assimilation-weighted leaf temperature (TL-AW) across 265 d, varying in air temperature (Tair) from −1 to 45°C. We compared these data to TL-AW derived from wood cellulose δ18O. Tleaf exhibited substantial variation driven by Tair, light intensity, and vapor pressure deficit, and Tleaf was strongly linearly correlated with Tair with a slope of c. 1.0. TL-AW values calculated from cellulose δ18O vs crown fluxes were remarkably consistent; both varied seasonally and in response to the warming treatment, tracking variation in Tair. The leaves studied here were nearly poikilothermic, with no evidence of thermoregulation of Tleaf towards a homeostatic value. Importantly, this work supports the use of cellulose δ18O to infer TL-AW, but does not support the concept of strong homeothermic regulation of Tleaf},

  abstract = {The larch forests at the southern limit of the Siberian boreal forest in Central Asia have repeatedly experienced strong recent growth declines attributed to decreasing summer precipitation in the course of climate warming. Here, we present evidence from the southernmost Larix sibirica forests in eastern Kazakhstan that these declines are primarily caused by a decrease in effective moisture due to increasing summer temperatures, despite constant annual, and summer precipitation. Tree-ring chronologies ({$>$}800 trees) showed a reduction by 50–80\% in mean ring width and an increase in the frequency of missing rings since the 1970s. Climate-response analysis revealed a stronger (negative) effect of summer temperature (in particular of the previous year’s June and July temperature) on radial growth than summer precipitation (positive effect). It is assumed that a rise in the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, which typically increases with temperature, is negatively affecting tree water status and radial growth, either directly or indirectly through reduced soil moisture. Larch rejuvenation ceased in the 1950s, which is partly explained by increasing topsoil desiccation in a warmer climate and a high drought susceptibility of larch germination, as was demonstrated by a germination experiment with variable soil moisture levels. The lack of regeneration and the reduced annual stem increment suggest that sustainable forest management aiming at timber harvesting is no longer feasible in these southern boreal forests. Progressive climate warming is likely to cause a future northward shift of the southern limit of the boreal forest.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause shifts in the composition of tropical montane forests towards increased relative abundances of species whose ranges were previously centered at lower, hotter elevations. To investigate this process of “thermophilization,” we analyzed patterns of compositional change over the last decade using recensus data from a network of 16 adult and juvenile tree plots in the tropical forests of northern Andes Mountains and adjacent lowlands in northwestern Colombia. Analyses show evidence that tree species composition is strongly linked to temperature and that composition is changing directionally through time, potentially in response to climate change and increasing temperatures. Mean rates of thermophilization [thermal migration rate (TMR), °C⋅y               −1               ] across all censuses were 0.011 °C⋅y               −1               (95\% confidence interval = 0.002–0.022 °C⋅y               −1               ) for adult trees and 0.027 °C⋅y               −1               (95\% confidence interval = 0.009–0.050 °C⋅y               −1               ) for juvenile trees. The fact that thermophilization is occurring in both the adult and juvenile trees and at rates consistent with concurrent warming supports the hypothesis that the observed compositional changes are part of a long-term process, such as global warming, and are not a response to any single episodic event. The observed changes in composition were driven primarily by patterns of tree mortality, indicating that the changes in composition are mostly via range retractions, rather than range shifts or expansions. These results all indicate that tropical forests are being strongly affected by climate change and suggest that many species will be at elevated risk for extinction as warming continues.},

Conclusions 42 Acknowledgements 42 References 42 Appendix A1 48 Summary Plant carbon metabolism is impacted by rising CO2 concentrations and temperatures, but also feeds back onto the climate system to help determine the trajectory of future climate change. Here we review how photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration are affected by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate warming, both separately and in combination. We also compile data from the literature on plants grown at multiple temperatures, focusing on net CO2 assimilation rates and leaf dark respiration rates measured at the growth temperature (Agrowth and Rgrowth, respectively). Our analyses show that the ratio of Agrowth to Rgrowth is generally homeostatic across a wide range of species and growth temperatures, and that species that have reduced Agrowth at higher growth temperatures also tend to have reduced Rgrowth, while species that show stimulations in Agrowth under warming tend to have higher Rgrowth in the hotter environment. These results highlight the need to study these physiological processes together to better predict how vegetation carbon metabolism will respond to climate change.},

Conclusions 703 Acknowledgements 703 References 703 Summary When the rate of photosynthesis is greatly diminished, such as during severe drought, extreme temperature or low light, it seems advantageous for plants to close stomata and completely halt water loss. However, water loss continues through the cuticle and incompletely closed stomata, together constituting the leaf minimum conductance (gmin). In this review, we critically evaluate the sources of variation in gmin, quantitatively compare various methods for its estimation, and illustrate the role of gmin in models of leaf gas exchange. A literature compilation of gmin as measured by the weight loss of detached leaves is presented, which shows much variation in this trait, which is not clearly related to species groups, climate of origin or leaf type. Much evidence points to the idea that gmin is highly responsive to the growing conditions of the plant, including soil water availability, temperature and air humidity – as we further demonstrate with two case studies. We pay special attention to the role of the minimum conductance in the Ball–Berry model of stomatal conductance, and caution against the usual regression-based method for its estimation. The synthesis presented here provides guidelines for the use of gmin in ecosystem models, and points to clear research gaps for this drought tolerance trait.},

  abstract = {Stable carbon isotope composition varies markedly between sun and shade leaves, with sun leaves being invariably more enriched (i.e., they contain more13C). Several hypotheses have emerged to explain this pattern, but controversy remains as to which mechanism is most general. We measured vertical gradients in stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) in more than 200 trees of nine conifer species growing in mixed-species forests in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA. For all species except western larch, δ13C decreased from top to bottom of the canopy. We found that δ13C was strongly correlated with nitrogen per unit leaf area (Narea), which is a measure of photosynthetic capacity. Usually weaker correlations were found between δ13C and leaf mass per area, nitrogen per unit leaf mass, height from the ground, or depth in the canopy, and these correlations were more variable between trees than for Narea. Gradients of δ13C (per meter canopy depth) were steeper in small trees than in tall trees, indicating that a recent explanation of δ13C gradients in terms of drought stress of upper canopy leaves is unlikely to apply in our study area. The strong relationship between Narea and δ13C here reported is consistent with the general finding that leaves or species with higher photosynthetic capacity tend to maintain lower CO2 concentrations inside leaves. We conclude that photosynthetic capacity is a strong determinant of δ13C in vertical canopy profiles, and must be accounted for when interpreting δ13C values in conifer forests.},

  abstract = {Mesophyll resistance to CO2 diffusion (rm) and the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax) affect photosynthetic rates, and can potentially also influence the percentage of respiratory and photorespiratory CO2 being refixated (Pr) by mesophyll cells. Here we investigated how various leaf anatomical traits (e.g. leaf mass per area [LMA] and leaf dry matter content [LDMC]) influenced rm in leaves of mature forest trees. We further explored how rm and Vcmax in turn affected Pr, and if these traits varied among species and leaves along a light gradient. Photosynthetic CO2 response of leaves grown in high-, medium-, and low-light environments was measured, from Pinus sylvestris [Scots pine], Picea abies [Norway spruce], Quercus robur [English oak], and Betula pendula [Silver birch] in southern Sweden. A modified version of the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model was fitted to the leaf gas exchange data to estimate Vcmax, rm and Pr. We found that of all leaf traits measured, only LMA for Q. robur was significantly higher in leaves from high-light environments. When comparing species, both rm and LMA were significantly higher in the conifers, and rm had a negative correlation with Vcmax. We found that Pr was similar between different species and functional groups, with an average of 73.2\% (and SD of ±10.4) across all species. There was a strong, positive correlation between Pr and Vcmax in broadleaves, and we hypothesise that this effect might derive from a higher CO2 drawdown near Rubisco in leaves with high Vcmax.},

This study investigated changes in leaf morphology and anatomy with tree age and height in the broadleaved evergreen species, Eucalyptus regnans. Fully expanded leaves were sampled from the upper canopy of tree ages ranging from 6 to 240 years, and tree heights ranging from about 10–80~m. There were significant changes in leaf form with increasing tree age and height. Leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area/leaf mass) decreased, leaf thickness increased, and leaves became narrower relative to their length, with increasing tree age and height. Cuticle thickness and leaf waxiness, including wax occlusion of the stomatal antechamber, increased with increasing age and height. By comparison, there were no clear trends in stomatal frequency or stomatal length with tree age, although there were curvilinear relationships between an index of total stomatal pore area per leaf lamina and both tree age and tree height. The results support the hypothesis that leaves of E. regnans become more xeromorphic with tree age and height. The results are discussed in relation to their significance for changes in water relations in the canopy with age.},

  abstract = {The~carbon sink capacity of tropical forests~is substantially affected by tree mortality. However, the main drivers of tropical~tree death remain largely unknown. Here we present a pan-Amazonian assessment of how and why trees die, analysing over 120,000 trees representing\,{$>$}\,3800 species from 189 long-term~RAINFOR forest plots. While tree mortality rates vary greatly Amazon-wide, on average trees are as likely to die standing as they are broken or uprooted—modes of death with different ecological consequences. Species-level growth rate is the single~most important predictor of tree death in Amazonia, with faster-growing species being at~higher risk. Within species, however, the slowest-growing trees are at greatest risk while the effect of tree size varies across the basin. In the driest Amazonian region~species-level bioclimatic distributional patterns also predict the risk of death, suggesting that these forests are experiencing climatic conditions beyond their adaptative limits. These results provide not only a~holistic pan-Amazonian picture of tree death but large-scale~evidence for the overarching importance of the growth–survival trade-off in driving tropical~tree mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ecologists are increasingly using plant functional traits to predict community assembly, but few studies have linked functional traits to species' responses to fine-scale resource gradients. In this study, it was tested whether saplings of woody species partition fine-scale gradients in light availability based on their leaf mass per area (LMA) in three temperate rain forests and one Mediterranean forest in southern Chile. METHODS: LMA was measured under field conditions of all woody species contained in approx. 60 plots of 2 m2 in each site, and light availability, computed as the gap light index (GLI), was determined. For each site, species' pairwise differences in mean LMA (Δ LMA) and abundance-weighted mean GLI (Δ light response) of 2 m2 plots were calculated and it was tested whether they were positively related using Mantel tests, i.e. if species with different LMA values differed in their response to light availability. Additionally linear models were fitted to the relationship between plot-level mean LMA and GLI across plots for each site. KEY RESULTS: A positive and significant relationship was found between species' pairwise differences in mean LMA and differences in light response across species for all temperate rain forests, but not for the Mediterranean forest. The results also indicated a significant positive interspecific link between LMA and light availability for all forests. This is in contrast to what is traditionally reported and to expectations from the leaf economics spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: In environments subjected to light limitation, interspecific differences in a leaf trait (LMA) can explain the fine-scale partitioning of light availability gradients by woody plant species. This niche partitioning potentially facilitates species coexistence at the within-community level. The high frequency of evergreen shade-intolerant species in these forests may explain the positive correlation between light availability and LMA.},

An alternative hypothesis is that steeper leaf angles have evolved to improve day-long carbon gain by emphasising light interception from low angles. • Here we relate variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites in Australian forest. Architectural comparison was made possible by combining 3D-digitising with the architecture model YPLANT. • Species with shallow angled leaves had greater daily light interception and potentially greater carbon gain. Self-shading, rather than leaf angle, explained most variance between species in light capture and potential carbon gain. Species average leaf size was the most important determinant of self-shading. • Our results provide the first cross-species evidence that steeper leaf angles function to reduce exposure to excess light levels during the middle of the day, more than to maximise carbon gain.},

Specifically, rising temperatures should cause increasing relative abundances of heat-loving or heat-tolerant species (that is, ‘thermophilization’) and changes in precipitation should cause altered abundances of water-demanding species. We analysed millions of records of thousands of species and found that the plant communities in most ecoregions in North, Central and South America have experienced thermophilization over the past four decades (1970–2011). Thermophilization was fastest in ecoregions with intermediate temperatures and was positively correlated with warming rates within many biomes. Changes in the relative abundances of water-demanding species were less consistent and were not correlated with changes in precipitation, meaning that the drought sensitivity of some ecoregions may be increasing despite decreasing rainfall and increasing probabilities of drought. Climate-driven changes in plant community composition will affect the function and stability of New World ecoregions.},

  abstract = {Shade tolerance, the minimum light requirement for plant survival, is a key trait for understanding community assembly and forest dynamics. However, it is poorly defined for tree species to date. Current methods of measuring shade tolerance vary considerably in their performance. For instance, some measures of shade tolerance are unreliable except under some specific conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the performance of these methods to provide guidance of choosing appropriate shade tolerance measures in future studies. We collected a large dataset of light traits and other life history traits for 137 understory wood species in a subtropical forest and tested the performance of five commonly used shade-tolerance indices. Results showed that all the shade-tolerance measures, except the low-light abundance index, performed poorly in distinguishing and ranking shade tolerance of the tested species.

  abstract = {Shade tolerance, the minimum light requirement for plant survival, is a key trait for understanding community assembly and forest dynamics. However, it is poorly defined for tree species to date. Current methods of measuring shade tolerance vary considerably in their performance. For instance, some measures of shade tolerance are unreliable except under some specific conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the performance of these methods to provide guidance of choosing appropriate shade tolerance measures in future studies. We collected a large dataset of light traits and other life history traits for 137 understory wood species in a subtropical forest and tested the performance of five commonly used shade-tolerance indices. Results showed that all the shade-tolerance measures, except the low-light abundance index, performed poorly in distinguishing and ranking shade tolerance of the tested species. The shade tolerance quantified by the low-light abundance was consistent with empirical classification of shade-tolerance/intolerance groups and successional seral stages of species. Comparison of the shade tolerance between trees of different diameter at breast height (DBH) or height classes further confirmed the reliability of low-light abundance.

We examined the role of these parameters as protection mechanisms in an altitudinal gradient of increasing UV radiation in northern Catalonia and in sun and shade leaves. The concentration of UV-B radiation absorbing pigments was 15\% higher in sun leaves of Q. ilex at 1200 m than in those from 200 m altitude. Sun leaves of R. ferrugineum presented concentrations three times higher than those of Q. ilex. Reflectance ranged between 5\% (in the region 300–400 nm) and 12\% (in the region 280–300 nm). The variation of reflectance with altitude followed an inverse trend respect to absorbance in the 280–300 nm region, with higher values the lower the altitude, but in the 300–400 nm region, reflectance of the lower site was the lowest. In both species and altitudes sun leaves presented higher concentrations of UV-B radiation absorbing pigments and UV reflectance than shade leaves. Quercus ilex trees of the higher location presented higher NDPI (Normalized Difference Pigment Reflectance Index) values, indicating higher carotenoids/chlorophyll a ratio. Actual measurements of carotenoid/chlorophyll a ratio confirmed this pattern. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) presented higher values the higher the location indicating lower photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency. Specific leaf weight (SLW) and leaf thickness were larger in Q. ilex trees of higher location than in those of lower location. In both sites, sun leaves also presented larger SLW values than shade leaves. Adaxial leaf hair density in sun leaves was significantlly higher in the lower location. UV absorption and linked morphological traits (SLW, leaf thickness measured in Q. ilex) presented the larger differences among studied plants at different altitudes and seem to be the dominant UV protecting mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Modification of foliage exposition and morphology by seasonal average integrated quantum flux density (Qint) was investigated in the canopies of the shade-tolerant latesuccessional deciduous tree species Fagus orientalis Lipsky and Fagus sylvatica L. Because the leaves were not entirely flat anywhere in the canopy, the leaf lamina was considered to be three-dimensional and characterized by the cross-sectional angle between the leaf halves (θ). Both branch and lamina inclination angles with respect to the horizontal scaled positively with irradiance in the canopy, allowing light to penetrate to deeper canopy horizons. Lamina cross-sectional angle varied from 170° in the most shaded leaves to 90–100° in leaves in the top of the canopy. Thus, the degree of leaf rolling increased with increasing Qint, further reducing the light-interception efficiency of the upper-canopy leaves. Simulations of the dependence of foliage light-interception efficiency on θ demonstrated that decreases in θ primarily reduce the interception efficiency of direct irradiance, but that diffuse irradiance was equally efficiently intercepted over the entire range of θ values in our study. Despite strong alteration in foliage light-harvesting capacity within the canopy and greater transmittance of the upper crown compared with the lower canopy, mean incident irradiances varied more than 20-fold within the canopy, indicating inherent limitations in light partitioning within the canopy. This extensive canopy light gradient was paralleled by plastic changes in foliar structure and chemistry. Leaf dry mass per unit area varied 3–4-fold between the canopy top and bottom, providing an important means of scaling foliage nitrogen contents and photosynthetic capacity per unit area with Qint. Although leaf structure versus light relationships were qualitatively similar in all cases, there were important tree-to-tree and species-to-species variations, as well as evidence of differences in investments in structural compounds within the leaf lamina, possibly in response to contrasting leaf water availability in different trees.},

Photoreceptor regulation of shade avoidance 932 References 940 IV. Molecular mechanisms in shade avoidance signalling 934 Summary The threat to plant survival presented by light limitation has driven the evolution of highly plastic adaptive strategies to either tolerate or avoid shading by neighbouring vegetation. When subject to vegetational shading, plants are exposed to a variety of informational signals, which include altered light quality and a reduction in light quantity. The former includes a decrease in the ratio of red to far-red wavelengths (low R : FR) and is detected by the phytochrome family of plant photoreceptors. Monitoring of R : FR ratio can provide an early and unambiguous warning of the presence of competing vegetation, thereby evoking escape responses before plants are actually shaded. The molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses to alterations in light quality have now started to emerge, with major roles suggested for the PIF (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR) and DELLA families of transcriptional regulators. Such studies suggest a complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous signals, mediated by multiple photoreceptors. The phenotypic similarities between physiological responses habitually referred to as ‘the shade avoidance syndrome’ and other abiotic stress responses suggest plants may integrate common signalling mechanisms to respond to multiple perturbations in their natural environment.},

  abstract = {Forest microclimates contrast strongly with the climate outside forests. To fully understand and better predict how forests' biodiversity and functions relate to climate and climate change, microclimates need to be integrated into ecological research. Despite the potentially broad impact of microclimates on the response of forest ecosystems to global change, our understanding of how microclimates within and below tree canopies modulate biotic responses to global change at the species, community and ecosystem level is still limited. Here, we review how spatial and temporal variation in forest microclimates result from an interplay of forest features, local water balance, topography and landscape composition. We first stress and exemplify the importance of considering forest microclimates to understand variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across forest landscapes. Next, we explain how macroclimate warming (of the free atmosphere) can affect microclimates, and vice versa, via interactions with land-use changes across different biomes. Finally, we perform a priority ranking of future research avenues at the interface of microclimate ecology and global change biology, with a specific focus on three key themes: (1) disentangling the abiotic and biotic drivers and feedbacks of forest microclimates; (2) global and regional mapping and predictions of forest microclimates; and (3) the impacts of microclimate on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of climate change. The availability of microclimatic data will significantly increase in the coming decades, characterizing climate variability at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales relevant to biological processes in forests. This will revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics, drivers and implications of forest microclimates on biodiversity and ecological functions, and the impacts of global changes. In order to support the sustainable use of forests and to secure their biodiversity and ecosystem services for future generations, microclimates cannot be ignored.},

  abstract = {Several studies have looked at how individual environmental factors influence needle morphology in conifer trees, but interacting effects between drought and canopy position have received little attention. In this study, we characterized morphological responses to experimentally induced drought stress in sun exposed and shaded current-year Norway spruce needles. In the drought plot trees were suffering mild drought stress, with an average soil water potential at 50 cm depth of -0.4 MPa. In general, morphological needle traits had greater values in sun needles in the upper canopy than in shaded needles in the lower canopy. Needle morphology 15 months after the onset of drought was determined by canopy position, as only sun needle morphology was affected by drought. Thus, canopy position was a stronger morphogenic factor determining needle structure than was water availability. The largest influence of mild drought was observed for needle length, projected needle area and total needle area, which all were reduced by \textasciitilde 27\% relative to control trees. Needle thickness and needle width showed contrasting sensitivity to drought, as drought only affected needle thickness (10\% reduction). Needle dry mass, leaf mass per area and needle density were not affected 15 months after the onset of mild drought. Our results highlight the importance of considering canopy position as well as water availability when comparing needle structure or function between conifer species. More knowledge about how different canopy parts of Norway spruce adapt to drought is important to understand forest productivity under changing environmental conditions.},

In this study, we evaluated anatomical changes in sun and shade needles of 20‐year‐old Norway spruce trees exposed to artificial drought stress. Canopy position was found to be important for needle structure, as sun needles had significantly higher values than shade needles for all anatomical traits (i.e., cross‐sectional needle area, number of tracheids in needle, needle hydraulic conductivity, and tracheid lumen area), except proportion of xylem area per cross‐sectional needle area. In sun needles, drought reduced all trait values by 10–40\%, whereas in shade needles, only tracheid maximum diameter was reduced by drought. Due to the relatively weaker response of shade needles than sun needles in drought‐stressed trees, the difference between the two needle types was reduced by 25\% in the drought‐stressed trees compared to the control trees. The observed changes in needle anatomy provide new understanding of how Norway spruce adapts to drought stress and may improve predictions of how forests will respond to global climate change.},

  abstract = {This revised and updated edition of Rudolf Geiger's classic text provides a clear and vivid description of the surface microclimate, its physical basis, and its interactions with the biosphere. The book explains the principles of microclimatology and illustrates how they apply to a wide array of subfields. Those new to the field will find it especially valuable as a guide to understanding and quantifying the vast and ever-increasing literature on the subject. This edition has been revised to keep abreast of current research in all aspects of microclimatology, to provide more examples of work from North America, and to more clearly illustrate how surface energy fluxes are linked to the nature of the surface environment. The authors have added discussions dealing with the speed of sound, the use of vegetative barriers to reduce sound, and physiological control of energy and moisture exchanges. They have also expanded the discussion of microclimatic effects on animal and human behavior and dwellings, as well as updated methods of measurement and notation. Designed as an introductory text for students in environmental science, this book will also be an essential reference for scientists seeking a clear understanding of the nature and physical basis of the climate near the ground, and its interactions with the biosphere.},

  abstract = {Dew deposition occurs in ecosystems worldwide, even in the driest deserts and in times of drought. Although some species absorb dew water directly via foliar uptake, a ubiquitous effect of dew on plant water balance is the interference of dew droplets with the leaf energy balance, which increases leaf albedo and emissivity and decreases leaf temperature through dew evaporation. Dew deposition frequency and amount are expected to be affected by changing environmental conditions, with unknown consequences for plant water stress and ecosystem carbon, water and energy fluxes. Here we present a simple leaf energy balance that characterizes the effect of deposition and the evaporation of dew on leaf energy balance, transpiration, and carbon uptake. The model is driven by five common meteorological variables and shows very good agreement with leaf wetness sensor data from the Blue Oak Ranch Reserve in California. We explore the tradeoffs between energy, water, and carbon balances for leaves of different sizes across a range of relative humidity, wind speed, and air temperature conditions. Our results show significant water savings from transpiration suppression up to 25\% for leaf characteristic lengths of 50 cm. CO2 assimilation is decreased by up to 12\% by the presence of dew, except for bigger leaves in windspeed conditions below 1 m s−1 when an increase in assimilation is expected.},

For example, the size and shape of leaves can affect the rates at which leaves exchange heat, take up carbon dioxide, and lose water vapor. Leaf size and shape can also affect the efficiency with which the total photosynthetic surface can be arranged, supported, and supplied. Adaptations in leaf form thus touch on several aspects of plant form and function, with implications for thermoregulation (Gates et al., 1968), efficiency of water use (Parkhurst and Loucks, 1972), photosynthetic potential (Cunningham and Strain, 1969), branching and rooting strategies (Givnish and Vermeij, 1976), productivity (Tsunoda, 1972), and, presumably, competitive ability.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests are mitigating the ongoing climate crisis by absorbing more atmospheric carbon than they emit. However, widespread increases in tree mortality rates are decreasing the ability of tropical forests to assimilate and store carbon. A relatively small number of large trees dominate the contributions of these forests to the global carbon budget, yet we know remarkably little about how these large trees die. Here, we propose a cohesive and empirically informed framework for understanding and investigating size-dependent drivers of tree mortality. This theory-based framework enables us to posit that abiotic drivers of tree mortality—particularly drought, wind and lightning—regulate tropical forest carbon cycling via their disproportionate effects on large trees. As global change is predicted to increase the pressure from abiotic drivers, the associated deaths of large trees could rapidly and lastingly reduce tropical forest biomass stocks. Focused investigations of large tree death are needed to understand how shifting drivers of mortality are restructuring carbon cycling in tropical forests.},

California’s 2012–2015 drought, with exceptionally low precipitation and warmth, and widespread conifer death, provides an opportunity to explore the chain of events leading to forest die-off. Here, we present the spatial and temporal patterns of die-off and moisture deficit during California’s drought, based on field and remote sensing observations. We found that die-off was closely tied to multi-year deep-rooting-zone drying, and that this relationship provides a framework with which to diagnose and predict mortality. Marked tree death in an intensively studied Sierra Nevada forest followed a four-year moisture overdraft, with cumulative 2012–2015 evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation by \textasciitilde 1,500\,mm, and subsurface moisture exhaustion to 5–15-m depth. Observations across the entire Sierra Nevada further linked tree death to deep drying, with die-off and moisture overdraft covarying across latitude and elevation. Unusually dense vegetation and warm temperatures accelerated southern Sierran evapotranspiration in 2012–2015, intensifying overdraft and compounding die-off by an estimated 55\%. Climate change is expected to further amplify evapotranspiration and moisture overdraft during drought, potentially increasing Sierran tree death during drought by \textasciitilde 15–20\%\,°C−1.},

  abstract = {The geologic history of closed-canopy forests is of great interest to paleoecologists and paleoclimatologists alike. Closed canopies have pronounced effects on local, continental and global rainfall and temperature patterns. Although evidence for canopy closure is difficult to reconstruct from the fossil record, the characteristic isotope gradients of the “canopy effect” could be preserved in leaves and proxy biomarkers. To assess this, we employed new carbon isotopic data for leaves collected in diverse light environments within a deciduous, temperate forest (Maryland, USA) and for leaves from a perennially closed canopy, moist tropical forest (Bosque Protector San Lorenzo, Panamá). In the tropical forest, leaf carbon isotope values range 10‰, with higher δ13Cleaf values occurring both in upper reaches of the canopy, and with higher light exposure and lower humidity. Leaf fractionation (Δleaf) varied negatively with height and light and positively with humidity. Vertical 13C enrichment in leaves largely reflects changes in Δleaf, and does not trend with δ13C of CO2 within the canopy. At the site in Maryland, leaves express a more modest δ13C range (∼6‰), with a clear trend that follows both light and leaf height. Using a model we simulate leaf assemblage isotope patterns from canopy data binned by elevation. The re-sampling (bootstrap) model determined both the mean and range of carbon isotope values for simulated leaf assemblages ranging in size from 10 to over 1000 leaves. For the tropical forest data, the canopy’s isotope range is captured with 50 or more randomly sampled leaves. Thus, with a sufficient number of fossil leaves it is possible to distinguish isotopic gradients in an ancient closed canopy forest from those in an open forest. For very large leaf assemblages, mean isotopic values approximate the δ13C of carbon contributed by leaves to soil and are similar to observed δ13Clitter values at forested sites within Panamá, including the site where leaves were sampled. The model predicts a persistent ∼1‰ difference in δ13Clitter for the two sites which is consistent with higher water availability in the tropical forests. This work provides a new framework for linking contemporary ecological observations to the geochemical record using flux-weighted isotope data and lends insights to the effect of forest architecture on organic and isotopic records of ancient terrestrial ecosystems.},

Fully expanded sun leaves had 47\% (mean of the three species) greater leaf mass area (LMA) and 31\% lower specific leaf area (SLA) than shade leaves. Palisade parenchyma thickness contributed on an average 42\% to the total leaf thickness, spongy layer 43\%, upper epidermal cells 5\%, and upper cuticle thickness 3\%. Stomatal size was greater in sun (25.5~μm) than in shade leaves (23.6~μm). Total chlorophyll content per fresh mass was 71\% greater in shade than in sun leaves, and nitrogen content was the highest in sun (13.7~mg~g−1) than in shade leaves (11.8~mg~g−1). Difference of net photosynthetic rates (PN) between sun and shade leaves was 97\% (mean of the three species). The plasticity index (sensu Valladares et~al., New Phytol 148:79–91, 2000a) was the highest for physiological leaf traits (0.86) than for morphological, anatomical and biochemical ones. Q. ilex had the highest plasticity index of morphological, anatomical and physiological leaf traits (0.37, 0.28 and 0.71, respectively) that might explain its wider ecological distribution. The higher leaf plasticity of Q. ilex might be advantageous in response to varying environmental conditions, including global change.},

The effects of shade on leaf morphology and anatomy, including stomatal density and chloroplast structure, net photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g s), and fruit yield were studied. Shade reduced leaf thickness due to the presence of only 1–2 palisade layers and reduced the length of palisade cells and spongy parenchyma. The number of thylakoids in grana as well as in stroma increased as shade increased, while the number of plastoglobuli decreased in proportion to the reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The higher the level of shade, the lower the stomatal and trichome density, leaf mass per area (ALM), g s, and P N. Shade of 30, 60, and 90 \% reduced stomatal density by 7, 16, and 27 \%, respectively, while the corresponding reduction in P N was 21, 35, and 67 \%. In contrast, chlorophyll a+b per fresh mass, and leaf width, length, and particularly area increased under the same shade levels (by 16, 33, and 81 \% in leaf area). P N reduction was due both to a decrease in PAR and to the morphological changes in leaves. The effect of shade was more severe on fruit yield per tree (32, 67, and 84 \%) than on P N indicating an effect on bud differentiation and fruit set. The olive tree adapts well to shade compared with other fruit trees by a small reduction in stomatal and trichome density, palisade parenchyma, and a significant increase in leaf area.}

  abstract = {During the exposition to moderate high-temperature stress, photosynthetic rates and fluorescence of chlorophyll a were measured with a photosynthetic measurement system (Li-Cor 6400) and leaf chamber fluorometer (Li-Cor6400 LCF), respectively, in leaves of saplings, sun-adapted species (Schima superba), shade-adapted species (Cryptocarya concinna), and in mesophytic plant (Castanopsis hystrix) (42°C). The results showed that moderate high-temperature stress led to a decrease in Fv/Fm, namely the primary photochemical quantum efficiency, indicating that moderate high-temperature stress causes a partial inhibition of PSII. It also showed that such an effect was more severe in the shade-adapted plant C. concinna than in the sun-adapted species S. superba. However, except for the sun-grown leaves of C. concinna, the moderate high-temperature stress increased the photosynthetic rate of leaves at high light intensity. Simultaneously, less photoinhibition was found to occur under high-light intensity, suggesting that the capacity of resistant-photoinhibition was stimulated by moderate high-temperature stress. The quantum yield of PSII (ϕPSII) decreased in the sun-grown leaves of S. superba and C. hystrix but did not show any significant change in leaves of the shade plant C. concinna and shade-grown leaves of sun plant S. superba or the mesophytic plant C. hystrix because they already had a very low ϕPSII under this condition. Moderate high-temperature stress led to a decrease in ϕPSII/ϕCO2 ratios, an estimate of the quantum requirement for CO2 assimilation, in the sun plant S. superba and the mesophytic plant C. hystrix because they were associated with the dissipation of a lower fraction of excitation energy. However, no significant changes were found in shade plant C. concinna and in shade-grown leaves of the other examined plants. The effect of moderate high-temperature (42°C) on photosynthesis depends on species and leaf type (sun and shade leaves) in the saplings of subtropical broad-leaved trees.},

  abstract = {Extreme summer heat waves are known to induce foliar and stem mortality in temperate forest ecosystems, yet our mechanistic knowledge of physiological thresholds for damage is lacking. Current spatiotemporal simulations of forest growth responses to climate change fail to explain the variability between co-occurring tree species to climate extremes, indicating a need for new model frameworks that include mechanistic understanding of trait-specific responses. In this context, using manipulative heat wave (hw) experiments we investigated ecophysiological responses and physiological recovery in four co-occurring temperate tree species of the southeastern United States including three deciduous angiosperms: southern red oak (Quercus falcata Michx.), shumard oak (Q. shumardii Buckl.) and, tulip-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and one evergreen conifer: eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.). The objectives were to investigate inter-specific differences in ecophysiological responses to hw events to understand mechanistic differences in resilience that may be useful for future model development. Two-year-old, well-irrigated potted saplings were exposed to progressively increasing extreme hw diurnal cycles followed by a recovery cycle, with peak midday air temperature increasing from 37 °C to a maximum of 51 °C on the third day of the hw. Plants were assessed for various photosynthetic and water use responses, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosystem-II (PSII) activity, leaf temperature and foliar pigments. Intense heat caused progressive down-regulation in net photosynthesis, but the stomata remained operational, which helped cool leaves through loss of latent heat. Even though whole plant transpiration increased for all species, the rate plateaued at higher hw events that allowed leaf temperature to exceed 45 °C, well beyond the optimal range. A significant increase in non-photochemical quenching over the hw cycles was evident in all species though indications of both transient and chronic PSII damage were evident in the most heat sensitive species, pine and tulip poplar. The oaks, especially Q. falcata, showed greater thermotolerance than other species with a higher threshold for photodamage to PSII, rapid overnight recovery of photoinhibition and minimal heat-induced canopy necrosis. We conclude that these co-occurring tree species exhibit large variability in thermotolerance and in their capability to repair both transient and chronic photodamage. Our results indicate that extreme heat induced damage to PSII within the leaf chloroplasts may be a mechanistic trait that can be used to project how different species respond to extreme weather events.},

These features include: gross investments of carbon and nitrogen substrates (e.g. leaf mass per unit area); stomatal density, distribution between adaxial and abaxial surfaces, and aperture; internal and external optical scattering structures; defensive structures, such as trichomes and spines; and defensive compounds, including UV screens, antifeedants, toxins, and silica abrasives. I offer a synthesis of selected publications, including some of my own. A unifying theme is the adaptive value of expressing certain structural features, posed as metabolic costs and benefits, for (1) competitive acquisition and use of abiotic resources (such as water, light and nitrogen) and (2) regulation of biotic interactions, particularly fungal attack and herbivory. Both acclimatory responses in one plant and adaptations over evolutionary time scales are covered where possible. The ubiquity of trade-offs in function is a recurrent theme; this helps to explain diversity in solutions to the same environmental challenges but poses problems for investigators to uncover numerous important trade-offs. I offer some suggestions for research, such as on the need for models that integrate biotic and abiotic effects (these must be highly focused), and some speculations, such as on the intensity of selection pressures for these structures.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to reviewing literature may be susceptible to bias and result in incorrect decisions. This is of particular concern when reviews address policy- and practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a ‘critical friend’ role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the ‘systematic review’ label, we go on to identify methodological solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support available to avoid these issues and call on the entire community, including systematic review specialists, to work towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and better decisions.},

  abstract = {Microclimate and photosynthesis of krummholz mat growth forms of Picea engelmanii (Parry) and Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt. were investigated to determine structural features which may aid survival in alpine environments. The structure of krummholz mats was described in terms of the vertical distribution of leaf area index and leaf area density, which exceeded 50 m-1 (based on total leaf surface area) near the canopy surface and approached zero below 30 cm from the surface in both species. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, 0.4-0.7 μm wavelengths) and wind decreased by an average of 6 and 50-fold, respectively, between 1 m above and 10 cm below mat surfaces in both species. Needle temperatures on a P. engelmannii krummholz mat during July averaged about 2° C above air temperature during the day, with a maximum overtemperature of greater than 20° C above \$T\_\{\textbackslash text\{air\}\}\$ during one sunlit period. At night, needle temperatures averaged 3-4° C below \$T\_\{\textbackslash text\{air\}\}\$. Net photosynthesis in year-old P. engelmannii shoots reached a maximum at 15-20° C during July and August. Surface shoots were light saturated at near 1200 μmoles m-2 s-1 PPFD, and had higher photosynthetic rates than subsurface, predominantly shaded shoots above 800 μmoles m-2 s-1. Shade shoots had higher photosynthetic rates when PPFD was below 600 μmoles m-2 s-1, and at 250 μmoles m-2 s-1 shade shoots maintained about 50\% of the net photosynthetic rate of sun shoots at light saturation. Shade shoots appeared capable of benefitting photosynthetically from elevated temperatures within krummholz mats despite relatively low light levels. Especially rapid photosynthesis may occur when canopy needles are illuminated by sunflecks and needle temperatures rise by 10° C or more. Snow cover appears crucial for the survival of needles during winter. Snow accumulated within krummholz needle canopies before the sub-canopy zone of unfoliated branches became filled. The concentrated needle growth in the krummholz canopy captured snow in early autumn without support from ground-level snowpack. Early snow cover in both species prevented cuticle abrasion and resulted in high winter needle water contents and viabilities for subsurface compared to surface needles which became abraded, severely dehydrated, and had high mortality between December and February, especially on windward sides of shoots. Extremely high concentrations of needles within krummholz mat canopies created an aerodynamic structure which elevated needle temperatures to more optimal photosynthetic levels in summer and resulted in more efficient snow accumulation in winter. These factors appear crucial for winter needle survival. Thus, krummholz mats appear to be an important adaptation in growth form which provides survival benefits in both summer and winter.},

  abstract = {The morphology, inclination, and spatial distribution of leaves in different parts of tree crowns are important determinants of the radiation, momentum, and gas exchange between the canopy and the atmosphere. However, it is not well known how these foliage-related traits vary among species differing in successional status. We measured leaf size, leaf mass area (LMA), leaf inclination (angle to the horizontal), leaf area density (LAD), total leaf area (leaf area index, LAI), and leaf area distribution across the crown in adult trees of five common, early to late-successional tree species (Betula pendula Roth, Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Carpinus betulus L., Tilia cordata Mill., and Fagus sylvatica L.) using different canopy access techniques and the harvest of foliated trees (29 trees in total). Leaf size increased continuously with crown depth in B. pendula and T. cordata but peaked at mid-crown in Q. petraea, C. betulus, and F. sylvatica to decrease toward the shade crown. By contrast, LMA and leaf angle decreased continuously with crown depth in all species, but the pattern of vertical change varied. The mid/late- and late-successional species had higher LAI, lower shade-leaf LMA, lower leaf angles (shade and sun crown), and higher LAD in the uppermost sun crown in comparison to early successional B. pendula. We assume that the most peripheral sun leaf layer is partly acting as a shield against excess radiation, with foliage properties depending on the structure of the shade crown. We conclude that the vertical change in leaf morphology, inclination, and spatial distribution in tree crowns is highly species specific, with partial dependence on the species\&rsquo; position in succession.},

  abstract = {Leaf-level responses to light environment (sun vs. shade) and high temperature were compared in two gallery forest oaks, bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) and chinquapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii). Our goal was to determine if species-specific differences in response to light or temperature could explain the distribution of these oaks in tallgrass prairie gallery forests. On the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area in NE Kansas (USA), bur oak is more abundant than chinquapin oak along lower reaches of streams where the forests are most productive and canopy closure is greatest. We hypothesized that bur oak is better able to acclimate physiologically to reduced light availability than chinquapin oak. Leaf level acclimation to low light in both oaks occurred through reduced photosynthetic light compensation points (PLC) (bur oak, 60.77 ± 3.02 μmol photons m−2 s−1 in sun leaves vs. 29.25 ± 0.29 photons m−2 s−1 in shade leaves; chinquapin oak, 49.47 ± 2.82 photons m−2 s−1 in sun leaves vs. 26.48 ± 1.74 photons m−2s−1 in shade leaves), resulting from nearly 50\% reductions in dark respiration and specific leaf mass in both species. Apparent quantum requirement (Qreq; mol photons mol−1 O2) did not differ between sun and shade leaves in either species, and only bur oak showed differences in sun and shade leaf shape. We also hypothesized that chinquapin oak, which is more abundant in exposed, upper stream reaches, has greater photosynthetic tolerance to the high temperatures characteristics of this region. The maximum temperature tolerances (Tmax) of these oaks were compared by measuring increases in chlorophyll fluorescence. For most of the growing season, Tmax in chinquapin oak was 2.0°C higher than in bur oak. Field measurements of leaf vs. air temperatures in seedlings and adult trees indicated that Tmax was more likely to be exceeded in bur than in chinquapin oak, particularly in seedlings exposed to high solar radiation loads. We concluded that differences in thermal tolerance, in addition to previously documented differences in water relations are important determinants of distributional patterns of these oaks within gallery forests.},

  abstract = {Once dominant but now largely excluded from eastern North America, open forests of savannas to woodlands occupy the ecosystem gradient between grasslands and closed forests. These fire-maintained systems differ in structure, processes, and species from closed canopy, succession-driven forests that currently dominate this region. In functional open forest ecosystems, frequent, low to mixed severity and intensity surface fires limit tree regeneration, depending on factors such as overstory tree density, resulting in relatively stable structure where overstory trees co-exist with a largely herbaceous understory. Reduced and spatially variable tree densities in open forests result in unique environmental conditions and function. Trees in open forests typically represent a small fraction of the biodiversity, which instead resides in the rich herbaceous ground layer. Rather than being constrained by overstory disturbances, succession, and biological legacies, the permanently open structure and herbaceous communities of open forests support invertebrate and vertebrate species throughout their lifetimes. Transition from open to closed forests across most of eastern North America during the past century produced a “new normal,” in which excluded open forests remain largely unrecognized at considerable conservation costs, particularly loss of key processes and wildlife species associated with a matrix of co-dominant tree and herbaceous layers. Management for open forests emphasizes the understory herbaceous plant community, similar to ephemeral seral stages of successional forest, rather than tree regeneration to produce an alternative outcome in structure, function, and support for biodiversity.},

Despite historical abundance of savannas and woodlands, the fundamental ecology of open forest ecosystems remains ill-defined when compared to either closed forests or grasslands. Open forests were characterized by simple internal stand structure consisting of a single stratum of variably spaced, often very old overstory trees and limited midstory, maintained by understory disturbance that controlled tree regeneration and allowed instead a taxonomically rich herbaceous groundlayer. In contrast, closed forests have dense woody growth throughout the vertical profile, limiting herbaceous plants. To provide further clarity about these ecosystems, we developed a canopy closure spectrum model dependent on the interactions between prevailing disturbance regimes of the historical and current eras, which affect either the tree understory (regeneration) or overstory, and tree traits of fire and shade tolerance. Recognition of different stand structures, disturbance regimes, and their interrelationships should expand understanding of open forests and limit ecological misunderstandings and restoration misapplications, thereby improving management of these once historically extensive ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The acclimation of leaf pigments and antioxidative systems along the vertical canopy light gradient was determined in mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak [Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.] trees in a mixed beech/oak forest in northwest Germany. The aim of the study was to investigate if the higher shade tolerance of beech, relative to oak, is correlated with characteristics of the leaf pigment composition and antioxidative systems. Both species showed a similar acclimative response to increasing light availability. Compared to shade leaves, leaves of the upper crown layer exhibited higher chlorophyll~a to chlorophyll~b ratios and higher contents of photoprotective carotenoids, ascorbate and glutathione per unit chlorophyll, and higher mean activities of ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione reductase. The comparison of beech and oak leaves sampled at crown positions with similar light environments revealed "shade-type" pigment characteristics for beech, relative to oak, whereas "sun-type" characteristics were found with respect to antioxidative systems. At a given average light availability level, leaves of F. sylvatica exhibited higher antioxidant contents and higher ascorbate peroxidase activities as compared to those of Qu. petraea. The data suggest that a higher antioxidative capacity is required in leaves of the more shade-tolerant species. The supposed higher production rate of radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beech can be explained by: (1) the lower energy utilizing capacity, as beech leaves show lower light-saturated rates of photosynthesis than oak leaves, and (2) by specific features of the photosynthetic apparatus as suggested by the pigment data. A higher ROS generation rate in beech versus oak leaves could be seen as a consequence of efficient photosynthesis under low light conditions. Therefore a high capacity of protection against oxidative stress might be a prerequisite of shade tolerance.},

  abstract = {Land use change is a major threat to biodiversity. One mechanism by which land use change influences biodiversity and ecological processes is through changes in the local climate. Here, the relationships between leaf area index and five climate variables – air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, specific humidity and soil temperature – are investigated across a range of land use types in Borneo, including primary tropical forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity. Air beneath canopies with high leaf area index is cooler and has higher relative humidity during the day. Forest microclimate is also found to be less variable for sites with higher leaf area indices. Primary forest is found to be up to 2.5°C cooler than logged forest and up to 6.5°C cooler than oil palm plantations. Our results indicate that leaf area index is a useful parameter for predicting the effects of vegetation upon microclimate, which could be used to make small scale climate predictions based on remotely sensed data.},

Isoprene emission capacity (measured at 30 °C and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 1000 µmol m−2 s−1) was significantly higher in sun leaves than in shade leaves when expressed on a leaf area basis (51 versus 31 nmol m−2 s−1; P {$<$} 0.01). Because leaf mass per unit area (LMA, g m−2) was higher in sun leaves than in shade leaves, emissions of sun and shade leaves expressed on a dry mass basis did not differ significantly (99 versus 89 µg C gDW−1 h−1; P = 0.05). Similar measurements in 1995 were consistent with the 1992 data, but data from leaves in more shaded locations demonstrated that isoprene emission capacity decreased with decreasing growth irradiance, irrespective of units of expression. Isoprene emission capacity in leaves of Q. coccinea Muenchh. and Q. velutina Lam. also declined steeply with canopy depth. Emission capacity, on a dry mass basis, showed no obvious pattern with canopy position in Q. prinus L. There was no difference in the temperature response of sun versus shade leaves of Q. alba, but shade leaves exhibited a greater quantum efficiency and saturated at lower irradiance than sun leaves. Rates of isoprene emission measured on branches of Q. alba were approximately 60\% of those measured on individual leaves, as a result of self-shading within branch enclosures. It is recommended that within-canopy variation in isoprene emission capacity be incorporated into regional emission models.},

Quantifying variation in leaf CO2 exchange within a forest canopy improves our understanding of forest carbon cycling, especially if this quantification is done in such a way that explores leaf response to environmental variables. The main goal of this study was to investigate how leaf structural and functional properties change in response to the changing environmental conditions that occur both within a tree canopy and along a gradient of elevation in a subtropical forest ecosystem in Puerto Rico. We employed novel field techniques that allowed measurement of leaf CO2 exchange in different canopy positions as well as over a large geographic extent. Our results indicate that leaf properties such as leaf metabolic rates [light-saturated net carbon assimilation (Amax) and dark respiration (Rd) rates], leaf chemistry (chlorophyll and nitrogen concentration), and leaf structure [leaf mass per area (LMA)] differed significantly among species of varying successional status, between leaf positions within a tree, and spatially across the elevation gradient. Data presented here contribute to the worldwide ‘leaf economics’ database and will be useful to those interested in changes in canopy carbon sequestration across gradients.},

  abstract = {Moderately elevated temperatures induce a rapid increase in the heat and light resistance of photosystem II (PSII) in higher-plant leaves. This phenomenon was studied in intact potato leaves exposed to 35 °C for 2 h, using chlorophyll fluorometry, kinetic and difference spectrophotometry and photoacoustics. The 35 °C treatment was observed to cause energetic uncoupling between carotenoids and chlorophylls: (i) the steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence emission excited by a blue light beam (490 nm) was noticeably reduced as compared to fluorescence elicited by orange light (590 nm) and (ii) the quantum yield for photosynthetic oxygen evolution in blue light (400–500 nm) was preferentially reduced relative to the quantum yield measured in red light (590–710 nm). Analysis of the chlorophyll-fluorescence and light-absorption characteristics of the heated leaves showed numerous analogies with the fluorescence and absorption changes associated with the light-induced xanthophyll cycle activity, indicating that the carotenoid species involved in the heat-induced pigment uncoupling could be the xanthophyll violaxanthin. More precisely, the 35 °C treatment was observed to accelerate and amplify the non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (in both moderate red light and strong white light) and to cause an increase in leaf absorbance in the blue-green spectral region near 520 nm, as do strong light treatments which induce the massive conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. Interestingly, short exposure of potato leaves to strong light also provoked a significant increase in the stability of PSII to heat stress. It was also observed that photosynthetic electron transport was considerably more inhibited by chilling temperatures in 35 °C-treated leaves than in untreated leaves. Further, pre-exposure of potato leaves to 35 °C markedly increased the amplitude and the rate of light-induced changes in leaf absorbance at 505 nm (indicative of xanthophyll cycle activity), suggesting the possibility that moderately elevated temperature increased the accessibility of violaxanthin to the membrane-located de-epoxidase. This was supported by the quantitative analysis of the xanthophyll-cycle pigments before and after the 35 °C treatment, showing light-independent accumulation of zeaxanthin during mild heat stress. Based on these results, we propose that the rapid adjustment of the heat resistance of PSII may involve a modification of the interaction between violaxanthin and the light-harvesting complexes of PSII. As a consequence, the thermoresistance of PSII could be enhanced either directly through a conformational change of PSII or indirectly via a carotenoid-dependent modulation of membrane lipid fluidity.},

  abstract = {To investigate whether sun and shade leaves respond differently to CO2 enrichment, we examined photosynthetic light response of sun and shade leaves in canopy sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) trees growing at ambient and elevated (ambient + 200 μl l−1) atmospheric CO2 in the Brookhaven National Laboratory/Duke University Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. The sweetgum trees were naturally established in a 15-year-old forest dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Measurements were made in early June and late August 1997 during the first full year of CO2 fumigation in the Duke Forest FACE experiment. Sun leaves had a 68\% greater leaf mass per unit area, 63\% more leaf N per unit leaf area, 27\% more chlorophyll per unit leaf area and 77\% greater light-saturated photosynthetic rates than shade leaves. Elevated CO2 strongly stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis of sun and shade leaves in June and August; however, the relative photosynthetic enhancement by elevated CO2 for sun leaves was more than double the relative enhancement of shade leaves. Elevated CO2 stimulated apparent quantum yield by 30\%, but there was no interaction between CO2 and leaf position. Daytime leaf-level carbon gain extrapolated from photosynthetic light response curves indicated that sun leaves were enhanced 98\% by elevated CO2, whereas shade leaves were enhanced 41\%. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect leaf N per unit area in sun or shade leaves during either measurement period. Thus, the greater CO2 enhancement of light-saturated photosynthesis in sun leaves than in shade leaves was probably a result of a greater amount of nitrogen per unit leaf area in sun leaves. A full understanding of the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on forest ecosystems must take account of the complex nature of the light environment through the canopy and how light interacts with CO2 to affect photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Plant respiration constitutes a massive carbon flux to the atmosphere, and a major control on the evolution of the global carbon cycle. It therefore has the potential to modulate levels of climate change due to the human burning of fossil fuels. Neither current physiological nor terrestrial biosphere models adequately describe its short-term temperature response, and even minor differences in the shape of the response curve can significantly impact estimates of ecosystem carbon release and/or storage. Given this, it is critical to establish whether there are predictable patterns in the shape of the respiration–temperature response curve, and thus in the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of respiration across the globe. Analyzing measurements in a comprehensive database for 231 species spanning 7 biomes, we demonstrate that temperature-dependent increases in leaf respiration do not follow a commonly used exponential function. Instead, we find a decelerating function as leaves warm, reflecting a declining sensitivity to higher temperatures that is remarkably uniform across all biomes and plant functional types. Such convergence in the temperature sensitivity of leaf respiration suggests that there are universally applicable controls on the temperature response of plant energy metabolism, such that a single new function can predict the temperature dependence of leaf respiration for global vegetation. This simple function enables straightforward description of plant respiration in the land-surface components of coupled earth system models. Our cross-biome analyses shows significant implications for such fluxes in cold climates, generally projecting lower values compared with previous estimates.},

The juveniles of the 17 species included in the study were grown in high light, similar to the exposed crowns of the adult trees. The traits were structural, biomechanical, chemical and photosynthetic. With increasing species gap dependence, leaf mass per area (LMA) decreased only slightly in juveniles and remained constant in adults, whereas punch strength together with tissue density decreased, and photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll increased. Contrary to what has been mostly found in evergreen tropical rainforest, the trade-off between investment in longevity and in productivity was evident at an essentially constant LMA. Of the traits pertaining to the chloroplast level, photosynthetic capacity per unit chlorophyll increased with gap dependence, but the chlorophyll a/b ratio showed no relationship. Adults had a twofold higher LMA, but leaf strength was on average only about 50\% larger. Leaf tissue density, and chlorophyll and leaf N per area were also higher, whereas chlorophyll and leaf N per unit dry mass were lower. Ranking of the species, relationships between traits and with the gap dependence of the species were similar for juveniles and adults. However, the magnitudes of most ontogenetic changes were not clearly related to a species’ gap dependence. The adaptive value of the leaf traits for juveniles and adults is discussed.},

A two-year study was conducted to assess the responses of stomatal conductance (Gc) and carbon assimilation (Anet) of dominant tree species (Liquidambar formosana, Quercus acutissima and Quercus variabilis) to increased N deposition at a canopy and understory N additions experimental platform in a temperate deciduous broadleaved forest. Five treatments included N addition of 25 and 50~kg~ha−1~y−1 onto either the canopy (C25 and C50) or the understory (U25 and U50), and a control treatment (CK, without N addition). Our results showed that neither canopy nor understory N addition had an impact on carboxylation capacity (Vcmax), the light saturated rate of electron transport (Jmax) and leaf-level net assimilation (AnL) of the studied tree species. Higher concentrations of N addition (U50 and C50 treatments) exerted negative impacts on Gc and Anet of L. formosana and Quercus acutissima under lower precipitation conditions, while lower concentrations of N addition (U25 and C25 treatments) had minimal impacts on overall ecophysiological function. The U50 treatment increased tree water use efficiency (WUE) of L. formosana in the second experimental year. Canopy and understory N addition generated differential effects on forest vegetation. The traditional approach with understory addition could not fully reflect the effects of increased N deposition on the canopy-associated assimilation processes.},

  abstract = {During exposure to direct sunlight, leaf temperature increases rapidly and can reach values well above air temperature in temperate forest understories, especially when transpiration is limited due to drought stress, but the physiological effects of such high-temperature events are imperfectly understood. To gain insight into leaf temperature changes in the field and the effects of temperature variation on plant photosynthetic processes, we studied leaf temperature dynamics under field conditions in European aspen (Populus tremula L.) and under nursery conditions in hybrid aspen (P. tremula \&times; P. tremuloides Michaux), and further investigated the heat response of photosynthetic activity in hybrid aspen leaves under laboratory conditions. To simulate the complex fluctuating temperature environment in the field, intact, attached leaves were subjected to short temperature increases (\&ldquo;heat pulses\&rdquo;) of varying duration over the temperature range of 30 \&deg;C\&ndash;53 \&deg;C either under constant light intensity or by simultaneously raising the light intensity from 600 \&mu;mol m\&minus;2 s\&minus;1 to 1000 \&mu;mol m\&minus;2 s\&minus;1 during the heat pulse. On a warm summer day, leaf temperatures of up to 44 \&deg;C were measured in aspen leaves growing in the hemiboreal climate of Estonia. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that a moderate heat pulse of 2 min and up to 44 \&deg;C resulted in a reversible decrease of photosynthesis. The decrease in photosynthesis resulted from a combination of suppression of photosynthesis directly caused by the heat pulse and a further decrease, for a time period of 10\&ndash;40 min after the heat pulse, caused by subsequent transient stomatal closure and delayed recovery of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield. Longer and hotter heat pulses resulted in sustained inhibition of photosynthesis, primarily due to reduced PSII activity. However, cellular damage as indicated by increased membrane conductivity was not found below 50 \&deg;C. These data demonstrate that aspen is remarkably resistant to short-term heat pulses that are frequent under strongly fluctuating light regimes. Although the heat pulses did not result in cellular damage, heatflecks can significantly reduce the whole plant carbon gain in the field due to the delayed photosynthetic recovery after the heat pulse.},

  abstract = {The vertical structure of a tropical rain forest is complex and multilayered, with strong variation of micro-environment with height up to the canopy. We investigated the relation between morphological traits of leaf surfaces and tree ecological characteristics in a Malaysian tropical rain forest. The shapes and densities of stomata and trichomes on the abaxial leaf surfaces and their relation with leaf characteristics such as leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA) were studied in 136 tree species in 35 families with different growth forms in the tropical moist forest. Leaf physiological properties were also measured in 50 canopy and emergent species. Most tree species had flat type (40.4 \%) or mound type (39.7 \%) stomata. In addition, 84 species (61.76 \%) in 22 families had trichomes, including those with glandular (17.65 \%) and non-glandular trichomes (44.11 \%). Most leaf characteristics significantly varied among the growth form types: species in canopy and emergent layers and canopy gap conditions had higher stomatal density, stomatal pore index (SPI), trichome density and LMA than species in understory and subcanopy layers, though the relation of phylogenetically independent contrasts to each characteristic was not statistically significant, except for leaf stomatal density, SPI and LMA. Intrinsic water use efficiency in canopy and emergent tree species with higher trichome densities was greater than in species with lower trichome densities. These results suggest that tree species in tropical rain forests adapt to a spatial difference in their growth forms, which are considerably affected by phylogenetic context, by having different stomatal and trichome shapes and/or densities.},

  abstract = {In addition to the limited availability of canopy resistance (rc) data for a variety of vegetation surfaces at different development stages, and at a range of soil water and climatic conditions, one challenge in practical application of the Penman–Monteith (PM) model is scaling up leaf level stomatal resistance (rL) to rc to represent an integrated resistance from plant communities to quantify field-scale evaporative losses. We present an integrated approach to scale up rL to rc. We measured rL for subsurface drip-irrigated (non-stressed) corn (Zea mays L.) plants and integrated a number of microclimatic and in-canopy radiation transfer parameters to scale up rL to rc. With the espousal of microclimatic and crop factors such as leaf area index for sunlit and shaded leaves, solar zenith angle, direct and diffuse solar radiation, we scaled up rL as a function of measured photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). We also estimated rc by solving the PM model on an hourly time-step using the Bowen ratio energy balance system-measured latent heat. There was an asymptotic relationship between the rL and PPFD. The rL showed a sudden (almost instantaneous) response to changing PPFD. The minimum value of rL was measured in the morning as 74sm−1 (PPFD=400μmolm−2s−1), whereas the maximum resistance occurred in the late afternoon as 910sm−1 (PPFD=111μmolm−2s−1). Beyond a certain amount of PPFD (approximately 800μmolm−2s−1), rL became less responsive to PPFD. Despite the changes in microclimatic conditions, the resistance remained relatively constant during the midday hours. A relatively constant pattern of rL was most likely during the period when the supply of water from plant roots kept pace with the transpiration rate. At lower PPFD (0–250μmolm−2s−1) and higher rL range ({$>$}150sm−1), rL was very sensitive to PPFD, as a small change in PPFD caused a large change in rL. PPFD alone explained 85\% of the variability in rc. The average root mean square difference between the measured and estimated rc was 11.1sm−1 (r2=0.93). Results are encouraging, as the integrated PPFD vs. rc approach to scale up rL to rc for non-stressed plants does not account for the effect of other factors such as vapor pressure deficit, carbon dioxide concentration, wind speed, and soil evaporation.},

  abstract = {Interspecific ecophysiological differences in response to different light environments are important to consider in regeneration behavior and forest dynamics. The diurnal changes in leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence of two dipterocarps, Shorea leprosula (a high light-requiring) and Neobalanocarpus heimii (a low light-requiring), and a pioneer tree species (Macaranga gigantea) growing in open and gap sites were examined. In the open site, the maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pn), photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (δ; F/Fm′), and relative electron transport rate (r-ETR) through PSII at a given photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was higher in S. leprosula and M. gigantea than in N. heimii, while non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) at a given PPFD was higher in N. heimii. The maximum values of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in M. gigantea and S. leprosula was higher in the open site (8–11 μmol m−2 s−1) than in the gap site (5 μmol m−2 s−1), whereas that in N. heimii was lower in the open site (2 μmol m−2 s−1) than in the gap site (4 μmol m−2 s−1), indicating that N. heimii was less favorable to the open site. These data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that ecophysiological characteristics link with plant’s regeneration behavior and successional status. Although Pn and stomatal conductance decreased at midday in M. gigantea and S. leprosula in the open site, both r-ETR and leaf temperature remained unchanged. This indicates that stomatal closure rather than reduced photochemical capacity limited Pn in the daytime. Conversely, there was reduced r-ETR under high PPFD conditions in N. heimii in the open site, indicating reduced photochemical capacity. In the gap site, Pn increased in all leaves in the morning before exposure to direct sunlight, suggesting a relatively high use of diffuse light in the morning.},

  abstract = {Diurnal changes in gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured in the top canopy leaves of the tropical rainforest tree species, Macaranga conifera (Zoll.) Muell. Arg. during a drought year. Maximum values of net photosynthetic rate (Pn, 10 μmol m−2 s−1) and stomatal conductance (gs, 0.2 mol m−2 s−1) were found in east-facing leaves in early morning. After 1000 h, both Pn and gs decreased. Minimum daytime values of Pn, gs, and photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (ΔF/Fm′) were found in horizontally fixed leaves. At a given electron transport rate through PSII (ETR), Pn was higher in early morning than at midday, suggesting a high rate of photorespiration at midday. We tested the hypothesis that the effect of low leaf temperature (Tleaf) on Pn is significant in the early morning, whereas the effect of low gs on Pn predominates at midday. In the early morning, when Tleaf was increased from 32 to 38 °C by artificial heating, Pn at a given ETR decreased 29\%, suggesting that the low Tleaf was associated with a high Pn. When Tleaf at midday was decreased from 37 to 32 °C by artificial cooling, Pn increased 22\%, but Pn at a given ETR was higher in early morning than at midday, even at the same low Tleaf (32 °C). This suggests that the rate of photorespiration was higher at midday than in early morning because low gs at midday caused a reduction in leaf intercellular CO2 concentration. We conclude that low Pn at midday was the result of both a reduction in the photochemical process and an increase in stomatal limitation.},

  abstract = {Because of their overwhelming size over other organisms, trees define the structural and energetic properties of forest ecosystems. From grasslands to forests, leaf area index, which determines the amount of light energy intercepted for photosynthesis, increases with increasing canopy height across the various terrestrial ecosystems of the world. In vertically well-developed forests, niche differentiation along the vertical gradient of light availability may promote species coexistence. In addition, spatial and temporal differentiation of photosynthetic traits among the coexisting tree species (functional diversity) may promote complementary use of light energy, resulting in higher biomass and productivity in multi-species forests. Trees have evolved retaining high phenotypic plasticity because the spatial/temporal distribution of resources in forest ecosystems is highly heterogeneous and trees modify their own environment as they increase nearly 1,000 times in size through ontogeny. High phenotypic plasticity may enable coexistence of tree species through divergence in resource-rich environments, as well as through convergence in resource-limited environments. We propose that the breadth of individual-level phenotypic plasticity, expressed at the metamer level (leaves and shoots), is an important factor that promotes species coexistence and resource-use complementarity in forest ecosystems. A cross-biome comparison of the link between plasticity of photosynthesis-related traits and stand productivity will provide a functional explanation for the relationship between species assemblages and productivity of forest ecosystems.},

We propose that in such forests, differentiation among coexisting species in their spatial and temporal strategies for light interception, results in complementary use of light. Spatial differentiation among coexisting tree species occurs as a result of adaptation of crown architecture and shoot/leaf morphology to the spatially variable light conditions of the canopy, sub-canopy, and understory. Temporal differentiation occurs as a result of variation in leaf phenology and photosynthetic activity. The arrangement of leaves in both space and time is an important aspect of plant strategies for light interception and determines photosynthetic carbon gain of the plant canopy. For example, at the shoot level, morphological and phenological differentiation between long and short shoots reflects their respective shoot functions, indicating that spatial and temporal strategies for light interception are linked. Complementary use of light is a consequence of the spatiotemporal differentiation in light interception among coexisting species. Because coexisting species may show differentiation in strategies for resource acquisition (functional diversification) or convergence with respect to some limiting resource (functional convergence), the relative importance of various crown functions and their contribution to growth and survival of individuals need to be evaluated quantitatively and compared among coexisting species.},

  abstract = {Because rates of migration and genetic adaptation are slow, individual trees must initially acclimate to climate change via individual-level plasticity. Therefore, when predicting distribution and persistence of tree species under future climate change scenarios, we must take into account geographical variation in intra-individual plasticity. Here, we investigated geographical variation of intra-individual plasticity of Fagus crenata Blume (Japanese beech), a dominant species in late-successional, cool-temperate forests of Japan. We compared within-crown variation of leaf morphology (intra-crown leaf plasticity, ILP) among 13 sites across the full distribution range of F. crenata. Generally, ILP was lower for trees in the Pacific than Japan-Sea genetic lineages, low for trees in southern sites, and high for trees in sites near the northern and altitudinal range edges. Among the 13 sites, ILP was correlated with environmental variables associated with temperature. Positive correlation between ILP and temperature variation suggested that environmental perturbation selects for high intra-individual plasticity near northern and altitudinal range edges where F. crenata is expanding its distribution range. On the other hand, low ILP of trees in Pacific and southern sites, comprising geographically isolated populations, may reflect low acclimation potential to environmental perturbation. This could lead to local extinction if climatic conditions exceed the range of tolerance resulting in retreat of the Pacific and southern range edges of F. crenata in Japan.},

  abstract = {The study of leaf anatomy and of the mechanisms of the opening and closing of stomatal guard cells leads one to suppose that the stomata constitute the main or even the sole regulating system in leaf transpiration. Meteorologists have developed a wide variety of formulae for estimating evaporation from vegetation that are based entirely on weather variables and take no account at all of the species composition or stomatal properties of the transpiring vegetation. These “potential evaporation” formulae are widely and, to a large degree, successfully used for estimating evaporation from vegetation that is not water-stressed. Transpiration depends on stomatal conductance, net radiation receipt and upon air saturation deficit, temperature, and wind speed. Saturation deficit and wind speed vary through leaf boundary layers, through canopies, and through the atmosphere above the canopies. The sensitivity of saturation deficit to changes in stomatal conductance depends on where the saturation deficit is measured. If all of the stomata on a single leaf change aperture in unison, there may be a substantial change in saturation deficit measured at the leaf surface but a negligible change in saturation deficit measured a centimetre or two away, outside the leaf boundary layer.},

The study of wind profile, defined as the change of wind velocity with height, and wind velocity are important because of tree physiological and developmental responses. Generally, wind profiles above the ground or at a canopy surface follow classical logarithm law, but wind profiles in a single tree and in a forest stand are not logarithmic. This paper summarizes the results of wind profile studies within a single tree, in a forest stand, above the forest canopy and in a forest area from recent research in a coastal pine forest. The results demonstrate that: 1) wind profiles with in a single conifer tree crown showed an exponential function with height, 2) wind profiles in forest stands were able to be expressed by attenuation coefficient of wind, 3) wind profiles over a forest canopy could be determined using profile parameters (friction velocity, roughness length and displacement), and 4) for a forest area, the extreme wind speed could be predicted reasonably using the methods developed for the design of buildings. More research will be required to demonstrate: 1) relationships between wind profiles and tree or stand characteristics, 2) the simple methods for predicting wind profile parameters, and 3) the applications of wind profile in studies of tree physiology, forest ecology and management, and the detail ecological effects of wind on tree growth.},

  abstract = {Canopy temperature exerts fundamental controls on plant-level physiological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, and growth and development, and consequently on ecosystem fluxes of carbon, water, and energy. New thermal remote sensing instruments and algorithms are offering unprecedented measurements of surface canopy temperature across space and time. However, airborne and satellite sensors only measure canopies from above, and the vertical heterogeneity of canopy temperatures remains largely unexplored. We combined data from the ECOSTRESS mission, lidar, and a FLIR thermal camera deployed in a Californian woodland savanna to answer the following questions: (1) What is the vertical heterogeneity of tree canopy temperature in a Mediterranean woodland savanna, and how does it vary diurnally, seasonally, and in response to environmental conditions?, and (2) How do blue oak (Quercus douglasii) tree canopy temperatures as measured by ECOSTRESS correspond with FLIR-measured, vertically-resolved temperatures? At any particular time, locations within a single blue oak canopy can vary by more than 4°C, while the difference in temperature between the top quarter and bottom quarter of the canopy can range ±2°C. Canopy temperatures are considerably more homogeneous at night and at other times with low incoming solar radiation. Comparisons with the newly-available ECOSTRESS thermal measurements will also be presented. Based on results from the thermal imaging camera, we predict that ECOSTRESS measurements are a good proxy for bulk canopy temperature under conditions of low incoming radiation, but are comparatively non-representative of canopy temperature when the temperature at the bottom of the canopy is significantly warmer or cooler than the temperature at the top, such as when the understory grass is dry, hot, and strongly radiating.},

In this study, E O and E U of a temperate deciduous forest stand located in South Korea were measured during the growing season of 2008 using sap flow methods. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the total transpiration of the forest stand, i.e., overstory and understory, (2) to determine their relative contribution to ecosystem evapotranspiration (E eco), and (3) to identify factors controlling the transpiration of each layer. E O and E U were 174 and 22~mm, respectively. Total transpiration accounted for 55~\% of the total E eco, revealing the importance of unaccounted contributions to E eco (i.e., soil evaporation and wet canopy evaporation). During the monsoon period, there was a strong reduction in the total transpiration, likely because of reductions in photosynthetic active radiation, vapor pressure deficit and plant area index. The ratio of E U to E O declined during the same period, indicating an effect of monsoon on the partitioning of E eco in its two components. The seasonal pattern of E O was synchronized with the overstory canopy development, which equally had a strong regulatory influence on E U.},

However, the trait-based approach to study plant performances and ecological strategies has mostly been focused on trait comparisons at the interspecific and intraspecific levels. In this study, we analyzed traits variation and association at the individual level. We measured wood and leaf traits at different height locations within the crown of five individuals of Pericopsis elata (Harms) Meeuwen (Fabaceae) from the northern tropical forest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All traits varied between and within individuals. The between-individual variation was more important for leaf traits (23\%\&ndash;48\%) than for wood traits (\textasciitilde 10\%) where the within-individual variation showed to be more important (33\%\&ndash;39\%). The sample location height within the crown was found to be the driving factor of this within-individual variation. In a gradient from the base to the top of the crown, theoretical specific hydraulic conductivity and specific leaf area decreased while the stomatal density increased. We found significant relationships among traits and between wood and leaf traits. However, these relationships varied with the position within the crown. The relationship between vessel size and vessel density was negative at the bottom part of the crown but positive upward. Also, the negative relationship between stomatal density and stomatal size became stronger with increasing height within the crown. Finally, the positive relationship between specific leaf area and theoretical specific hydraulic conductivity became stronger in higher parts of the crown, suggesting that P. elata constantly adapts its water use with respect to its water supply, more strongly at the top of the crown where the environment is more extreme and less buffered against environmental fluctuations.},

Owing to the exponential decrease of light availability through canopies, however, the vast majority of the world's vegetation exists in at least partial shade. Plant functional traits vary in direct dependence of light availability3, with different traits varying to different degrees, sometimes in conflict with expectations from the economic spectrum3. This means that the derived trait relationships of the global leaf economic spectrum are probably dependent on the extent to which observed data in existing large-scale plant databases represent high-light conditions. Here, using an extensive worldwide database of within-canopy gradients of key physiological, structural and chemical traits3, along with three different global trait databases4,5, we show that: (1) accounting for light-driven trait plasticity can reveal novel trait relationships, particularly for highly plastic traits (for example, the relationship between net assimilation rate per area (Aa) and leaf mass per area (LMA)); and (2) a large proportion of leaf traits in current global plant databases reported as measured in full sun were probably measured in the shade. The results show that even though the majority of leaves exist in the shade, along with a large proportion of observations, our current understanding is too focused on conditions in the sun.},

Despite the importance of these two processes, it is not possible to measure either at the ecosystem scale during the daytime. Eddy-covariance measurements are widely used as the closest ‘quasi-direct’ ecosystem-scale observation from which to estimate ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Recent research, however, suggests that current estimates may be biased by up to 25\%, due to a previously unaccounted for process: the inhibition of leaf respiration in the light. Yet the extent of inhibition remains debated, and implications for estimates of ecosystem-scale respiration and photosynthesis remain unquantified. Here, we quantify an apparent inhibition of daytime ecosystem respiration across the global FLUXNET eddy-covariance network and identify a pervasive influence that varies by season and ecosystem type. We develop partitioning methods that can detect an apparent ecosystem-scale inhibition of daytime respiration and find that diurnal patterns of ecosystem respiration might be markedly different than previously thought. The results call for the re-evaluation of global terrestrial carbon cycle models and also suggest that current global estimates of photosynthesis and respiration may be biased, some on the order of magnitude of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions.},

  abstract = {Models of tree responses to climate typically project that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCa) will reduce drought impacts on forests. We tested one of the mechanisms underlying this interaction, the ‘low Ci effect’, in which stomatal closure in drought conditions reduces the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), resulting in a larger relative enhancement of photosynthesis with eCa, and, consequently, a larger relative biomass response. We grew two Eucalyptus species of contrasting drought tolerance at ambient and elevated Ca for 6–9 months in large pots maintained at 50\% (drought) and 100\% field capacity. Droughted plants did not have significantly lower Ci than well-watered plants, which we attributed to long-term changes in leaf area. Hence, there should not have been an interaction between eCa and water availability on biomass, and we did not detect one. The xeric species did have higher Ci than the mesic species, indicating lower water-use efficiency, but both species exhibited similar responses of photosynthesis and biomass to eCa, owing to compensatory differences in the photosynthetic response to Ci.

  abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate changes in leaf morphological and physiological traits with tree height from dark understory to bright canopy conditions in various tree species in the Cambodian tropical dry evergreen forest. The vegetation mainly consisted of Dipterocarpaceae and Myristicaceae and the canopy trees usually reached 30-40 m in height. We investigated 25 individuals of 18 tree species ranging from 0.8 to 33 m in height. We measured the leaf photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and respiration rate for 3 to 5 leaves per sampling position in the early dry season. All leaves were then divided into two parts: one for measuring dry weight, nitrogen content and δ13C; the other for observation of leaf morphology. The leaf morphological traits, such as leaf mass per area (LMA), cuticle thickness, palisade layer thickness, leaf hardness and stomatal density increased linearly with tree height. The leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area (Narea) peaked at 10 m from the ground, though the nitrogen content per unit dry leaf mass (Nmass) decreased linearly with tree height. Higher LMA, cuticle thickness and hard leaves in canopy condition may contribute to high drought tolerance and physical strength. The leaf-area-based photosynthetic rate (Amax-area) peaked at an intermediate tree height of approximately 10 m, and then decreased toward the upper canopy. In contrast, the leafmass-based photosynthetic rate (Amax-mass) decreased linearly with tree height. Reduction of leaf nitrogen content and stomatal conductance mainly limit photosynthetic capacities with tree height. Overall, many leaf morphological traits could be summarized in a simple and significant relation with tree height, though increasing tree height, which is related to the micro-climatic gradient, leads to both nitrogen and stomatal constraints of leaf photosynthetic capacities, even when considering many different tree species.},

  abstract = {Extreme heat events will become more frequent under anthropogenic climate change, especially in Mediterranean ecosystems. Microhabitats can considerably moderate (buffer) the effects of extreme weather events and hence facilitate the persistence of some components of the biodiversity. We investigate the microclimatic moderation provided by two important microhabitats (cavities formed by the leaves of the grass-tree Xanthorrhoea semiplana F.Muell., Xanthorrhoeaceae; and inside the leaf-litter) during the summer of 2015/16 on the Fleurieu Peninsula of South Australia. We placed microsensors inside and outside these microhabitats, as well as above the ground below the forest canopy. Grass-tree and leaf-litter microhabitats significantly buffered against high temperatures and low relative humidity, compared to ground-below-canopy sensors. There was no significant difference between grass-tree and leaf-litter temperatures: in both microhabitats, daily temperature variation was reduced, day temperatures were 1–5°C cooler, night temperatures were 0.5–3°C warmer, and maximum temperatures were up to 14.4°C lower, compared to ground-below-canopy sensors. Grass-tree and leaf-litter microhabitats moderated heat increase at an average rate of 0.24°C temperature per 1°C increase of ambient temperature in the ground-below-canopy microhabitat. The average daily variation in temperature was determined by the type (grass-tree and leaf-litter versus ground-below-canopy) of microhabitat (explaining 67\%), the amount of canopy cover and the area of the vegetation fragment (together explaining almost 10\% of the variation). Greater canopy cover increased the amount of microclimatic moderation provided, especially in the leaf-litter. Our study highlights the importance of microhabitats in moderating macroclimatic conditions. However, this moderating effect is currently not considered in species distribution modelling under anthropogenic climate change nor in the management of vegetation. This shortcoming will have to be addressed to obtain realistic forecasts of future species distributions and to achieve effective management of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The assimilation of carbon by plant communities (gross primary production [GPP]) is a central concern in plant ecology as well as for our understanding of global climate change. As an alternative to traditional methods involving destructive harvests or time‐consuming measurements, we present a simple, general model for GPP as the product of the lifetime carbon gain by a single leaf, the daily leaf production rate, and the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis. To test the model, we estimated leaf lifetime carbon gain for 26 species using the concept of mean labor time for leaves (the part of each day the leaf functions to full capacity), average potential photosynthetic capacity over the leaf lifetime, and functional leaf longevity (leaf longevity discounted for periods within a year wholly unfavorable for photosynthesis). We found that the lifetime carbon gain of leaves was rather constant across species. Moreover, when foliar biomass was regressed against functional leaf longevity, aseasonal and seasonal forests fell on a single line, suggesting that the leaf production rate during favorable periods is not substantially different among forests in the world. The gross production of forest ecosystems then can be predicted to a first approximation simply by the annual duration of the period favorable for photosynthetic activity in any given region.},

  abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) techniques to collect thermal imagery have been useful for recording quasi-continuous plant surface temperatures. In this study, we applied a thermal camera to measure canopy skin temperatures in a mature ponderosa pine forest in central Oregon over one growing season from May to September 2014. This study had the following objectives: (1) to examine spatial and temporal variations of canopy temperature; (2) to explore the effects of climate and soil conditions on canopy temperature; and (3) to quantify the relationships of canopy temperatures to forest-atmosphere heat and carbon fluxes. The temporal variation of 30-min mean canopy temperature was large, and leaf temperatures ranged from −2.1 to 33.6°C during the study period. The temperature difference was small between the whole canopy and leaf regions, while tree stems had warmer temperatures than leaves, especially during the afternoon (12:00–19:59h). The canopy thermal regime was largely controlled by climatic conditions and related to the soil thermal states. Air temperature, relative humidity, longwave radiation, and soil temperature at 2-cm depth were tightly correlated with 30-min and daily/sub-daily mean canopy leaf temperatures (r≥0.6 or ≤−0.6, p{$<$}0.01). The daily/sub-daily mean canopy temperatures contained stronger relationships with the climatic and soil variables than the 30-min mean temperatures. During the afternoon, the mean leaf temperature was more closely related to net ecosystem exchange (r2=0.69) than air temperature, driven by the strong relationship between tissue temperature and photosynthesis and respiration. Our results show that canopy thermal conditions can be monitored almost continuously for extended time periods to better characterize how canopies respond to environmental conditions. Finally, thermal measurements show great promise for quantifying linkages to carbon exchange in forest ecosystems.},

This study evaluated the accuracy of TIR measurements of a conifer tree that were made using the thermal camera’s factory default settings, and developed a post-collection data processing method to correct measurements for ambient conditions that depart from the factory default settings. We conducted a 42-day measurement campaign in Corvallis, Oregon during spring 2014 that focused on the canopy temperature of a noble fir (Abies procera) and included the simultaneous collection of meteorological data and leaf temperature measurements with an array of thermocouples. We then developed empirical functions for temperature corrections that better accounted for emissivity, and atmospheric and reflected temperature. The original TIR temperatures using the factory settings averaged 8.6±5.6°C (−4.2 to 25.4°C in range), and the original TIR temperatures differed from the thermocouple temperatures by 1.4–1.6K. The TIR temperatures were generally accurate, except for a low temperature bias at leaf temperatures below 5°C. TIR temperature corrections reduced this bias to a {$<$}1.0K mean error relative to the thermocouples. Our results show that TIR measurements can be corrected to more accurately quantify canopy temperature, and that the importance of this correction increases under more extreme ambient conditions, such as colder periods.},

  abstract = {As photoinhibition primarily reduces the photosynthetic light use efficiency at low light, sunfleck-induced photoinhibition might result in a fatal loss of carbon gain in the shade leaves within a canopy with barely positive carbon balance. We hypothesized that shade leaves at the lower canopy might retain a certain amount of leaf nitrogen (NL) to maintain energy consumption via electron transport, which contributes to circumventing photoinhibition during sunflecks to keep efficient utilization of low light during the rest period of daytime. We investigated excess energy production, a potential measure of susceptibility to photoinhibition, as a function of NL distribution within a Japanese oak canopy. Optimal NL distribution, which maximizes canopy carbon gain, may lead to a higher risk of photoinhibition in shade leaves during sunflecks. Conversely, uniform NL distribution would cause a higher risk of photoinhibition in sun leaves under the direct sunlight. Actual NL distribution equalized the risk of photoinhibition throughout the canopy indicated by the constant excess energy production at the highest light intensities that the leaves received. Such a homeostatic adjustment as a whole canopy concerning photoinhibition would be a key factor to explain why actual NL distribution does not maximize canopy carbon gain.},

  abstract = {We investigated the morphological and physiological acclimation of leaves grown within a canopy of Japanese oak tree (Quercus mongolica var. crispula) in terms of the susceptibility to photoinhibition under various growth light conditions. The maximum rates of photosynthesis (Pmax) and electron transport (ETRmax) were higher in mature leaves grown under stronger light with higher area-based leaf nitrogen (N) content closely associated with higher leaf mass per area. The net photosynthetic (Pn) and electron transport (ETR) rates corresponding to the daily peak photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFDmax) during leaf maturation were almost comparable to Pmax and ETRmax, respectively. Conversely, Pn and ETR at the daily average PPFD (PPFDavg) were substantially low in shade-grown leaves when compared with Pmax and ETRmax. The susceptibility to photoinhibition at PPFDmax, i.e. at sunflecks for the shade-grown leaves, was assessed by the rate of excess energy production. Although sun leaves showed higher rates of electron transport and thermal energy dissipation than shade leaves under PPFDmax conditions, the rate of excess energy production was almost constant across shade to sun leaves. The shade leaves of the Japanese oak grown within a crown were suggested to adjust their N investment to maintain higher photosynthetic capacities compared with those required to maximize the net carbon gain, which may facilitate the dissipation of the excessive light energy of sunflecks to circumvent photoinhibition in cooperation with thermal energy dissipation.},

The three deciduous broadleaf tree species were Betula platyphylla var. japonica, pioneer and early successional, Quercus mongolica, intermediate shade-tolerant and mid-successional, and Acer mono, shade-tolerant and late successional. Tree seedlings were raised under three light regimes: full sunlight (open), 10\% full sun, and 5\% full sun. Susceptibility to photoinhibition was assessed on the basis of the recovery kinetics of the ratio of vaviable to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) of detached leaf discs exposed to about 2000 μmol m−1 s−1 photon flux density (PFD) for 2 h under controlled conditions (25 to 28 °C, fully hydrated). Differences in susceptibility to photodamage among species were not significant in the open and 10\% full sun treatments. But in 5\% full sun, B. platyphylla sustained a significantly greater photodamage than other species, probably associated with having the lowest photosynthetic capacity indicated by light-saturated photosynthetic rate (B. platyphylla, 9·87, 5·85 and 2·82; Q. mongolica, 8·05, 6·28 and 4·41; A. mono, 7·93, 6·11 and 5·08 μmol CO2 m−1 s−1for open, 10\% and 5\% full sun, respectively). To simulate a gap formation and assess its complex effects including high temperature and water stress in addition to strong light on the susceptibility to photoinhibition, we examined photoinhibition in the field by means of monitoring ΔF/F′m on the first day of transfer to natural daylight. Compared with ΔF/F′m in AM, the lower ΔF/F′m in PM responding to lower PFD following high PFD around noon indicated that photoinhibition occurred in plants grown in 10 and 5\% full sun. The diurnal changes of ΔF/F′m showed that Q. mongolica grown in 5\% full sun was less susceptible to photoinhibition than A. mono although they showed little differences both in photosynthetic capacity in intact leaves and susceptibility to photoinhibition based on leaf disc measurements. These results suggest that shade-grown Q. mongolica had a higher tolerance for additional stresses such as high temperature and water stress in the field, possibly due to their lower plasticity in leaf anatomy to low light environment.},

We analysed the relationship between the tree canopy water storage capacity and leaf wettability under changing simulated rainfall temperature. We estimated the effect of the rain temperature change on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of leave and needle surfaces based on two scenarios. Six dominant forest trees were analysed: English oak (Quercus roburL.), common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill), silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.),and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.). Twigs of these species were collected from Krynica Zdrój, that is, the Experimental Forestry unit of the University of Agriculture in Cracow (southern Poland). Experimental analyses (simulations of precipitation) were performed in a laboratory under controlled conditions. The canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability classification were determined at 12 water temperatures and a practical calculator to compute changes of S and contact angles of droplets was developed. Among all species, an increase of the rainfall temperature by 0.7 °C decreases the contact angle between leave and needle surfaces by 2.41° and increases the canopy storage capacity by 0.74 g g−1; an increase of the rain temperature by 2.7 °C decreases the contact angle by 9.29° and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2.85 g g−1. A decreased contact angle between a water droplet and leaf surface indicates increased wettability. Thus, our results show that an increased temperature increases the leaf wettability in all examined species. The comparison of different species implies that the water temperature has the strongest effect on spruce and the weakest effect on oak. These data indicate that the rainfall temperature influences the canopy storage capacity.},

  abstract = {The response of tree leaf gas exchange to elevated CO2 concentrations has been investigated in numerous experiments along the past 30 years. Stomatal regulation is a major plant control over leaf gas exchange, and the response to the increasing CO2 will shape the biological activity of forests in the future. Here, we collected 144 records from 57 species on stomatal conductance in CO2 manipulation experiments on trees (340–980 ppm CO2). CO2-induced stomatal downregulation was calculated as the slope of the linear regression between stomatal conductance and [CO2]. Among tree species, the slope (a) of change in stomatal conductance per 100 ppm CO2 increase ranged between 0 and −151, indicating stomatal downregulation, and only four species showed upregulation. There was a significant divergence between evergreen gymnosperms (a = −3.6 ± 1.0), deciduous angiosperms (a = −16.3 ± 3.1) and evergreen angiosperms (a = −32.8 ± 7.1). Gymnosperms were less sensitive to CO2 changes than deciduous angiosperms even when considering only field experiments. The significant role of tree functional group in predicting CO2-induced stomatal downregulation was detected in multiple mixed-effect models, with p values ranging between 0.0002 and 0.0295. The significantly higher stomatal sensitivity to CO2 of angiosperms versus gymnosperms might be related to the overall higher stomatal conductance of angiosperms; their thinner leaves, in turn losing water faster; and the decreasing atmospheric [CO2] at the time of their taxa diversification. We conclude that species differences must be taken into account in forecasting future forest fluxes. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Diurnal patterns of leaf conductance, net photosynthesis and water potential of five tree species were measured at the top of the canopy in a tropical lowland rain forest in southwestern Cameroon. Access to the 40 m canopy was by a large canopy-supported raft, the Radeau des Cimes. The measurements were made under ambient conditions, but the raft altered the local energy balance at times, resulting in elevated leaf temperatures. Leaf water potential was equal to or greater than the gravitational potential at 40 m in the early morning, falling to values as low as –3.0 MPa near midday. Net photosynthesis and conductance were typically highest during midmorning, with values of about 10–12 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 and 0.2–0.3 mol H2O m−2 s−1, respectively. Leaf conductance and net photosynthesis commonly declined through midday with occasional recovery late in the day. Photosynthesis was negatively related to leaf temperature above midday air temperature maxima. These patterns were similar to those observed in other seasonally droughted evergreen communities, such as Mediterranean-climate shrubs, and indicate that environmental factors may cause stomatal closure and limit photosynthesis in tropical rain forests during the midday period.},

The height to which trees can grow and the biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict heights of up to 120\,m in the absence of mechanical damage3,4, but there are historical accounts of taller trees5. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis6. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7\,m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122–130\,m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

The latter hypothesis was supported by the observations on tree growth.},

(1) Sun-exposed leaves of canopy tree species showed the highest photosynthetic capacities and largest xanthophyll-cycle pools (violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin) of about 87 mmol mol-1 chlorophyll with only small amounts of α-carotene [about 7 mmol mol-1 chlorophyll = 8\% of total (α+β) carotene pool]. Under high natural photon flux densities (PFDs) canopy leaves rapidly converted up to 96\% of the xanthophyll-cycle pool into zeaxanthin. The back reaction to violaxanthin occurred much faster in low light than in complete darkness. At the end of the night, zeaxanthin still accounted for, on average, 14\% of the total xanthophyll-cycle pigments. (2) Leaves of gap plants had intermediate values of \$\textbackslash text\{PS\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{max\}\}\$ and a 43\% lower total carotenoid content than canopy leaves. The average size of the xanthophyll-cycle pool was 35 mmol mol-1 chlorophyll, and α-carotene accounted for up to 66\% of the total (α+β) carotene pool. Under high light conditions gap plants converted, on average, 86\% of the xanthophyll-cycle pigments into zeaxanthin. The back reaction, following a decrease in ambient PFD, was slower than the forward reaction. At the end of the night, zeaxanthin accounted for, on average, 7\% of the xanthophyll-cycle pigments in gap plants. (3) Understory plants showed the lowest values of \$\textbackslash text\{PS\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{max\}\}\$ and the smallest xanthophyll-cycle pool of about 22 mmol mol-1 chlorophyll. α-Carotene accounted for up to 70\% of total carotene. The conversion of xanthophyll-cycle pigments into zeaxanthin was negligible during short sunflecks of 1-2 min duration and PFDs up to about 400 μmol m-2s-1. At predawn, leaves of understory plants rarely contained any detectable zeaxanthin. Aechmea magdalenae, an understory CAM plant, showed exceptionally high rates of \$\textbackslash text\{PS\}\_\{\textbackslash text\{max\}\}\$ per unit leaf area compared to sympatric C₃ understory species.},

  abstract = {Aim At a coarse scale, the treelines of the world's mountains seem to follow a common isotherm, but the evidence for this has been indirect so far. Here we aim at underpinning this with facts. Location We present the results of a data-logging campaign at 46 treeline sites between 68° N and 42° S. Methods We measured root-zone temperatures with an hourly resolution over 1–3 years per site between 1996 and 2003. Results Disregarding taxon-, landuse- or fire-driven tree limits, high altitude climatic treelines are associated with a seasonal mean ground temperature of 6.7 °C (±0.8 SD; 2.2 K amplitude of means for different climatic zones), a surprisingly narrow range. Temperatures are higher (7–8 °C) in the temperate and Mediterranean zone treelines, and are lower in equatorial treelines (5–6 °C) and in the subarctic and boreal zone (6–7 °C). While air temperatures are higher than soil temperatures in warm periods, and are lower than soil temperatures in cold periods, daily means of air and soil temperature are almost the same at 6–7 °C, a physics driven coincidence with the global mean temperature at treeline. The length of the growing season, thermal extremes or thermal sums have no predictive value for treeline altitude on a global scale. Some Mediterranean (Fagus spp.) and temperate South Hemisphere treelines (Nothofagus spp.) and the native treeline in Hawaii (Metrosideros) are located at substantially higher isotherms and represent genus-specific boundaries rather than boundaries of the life-form tree. In seasonal climates, ground temperatures in winter (absolute minima) reflect local snow pack and seem uncritical. Main conclusions The data support the hypothesis of a common thermal threshold for forest growth at high elevation, but also reflect a moderate region and substantial taxonomic influence.},

Dark respiration rate (Rn), maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and stomatal coefficient (m), the ratio of stomatal conductance to net assimilation rate after adjustment to the vapor pressure deficit and internal carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, were derived inversely from instantaneous field gas exchange data (one-point method). The normalized values of Rn and Vcmax at the reference temperature of 25 °C (Rn25, Vcmax25) and their temperature dependencies (ΔHa(Rn), ΔHa(Vcmax)) were analyzed. Parameter Vcmax25 ranged from 24.0–40.3 µmol m – 2 s – 1 and ΔHa(Vcmax) ranged from 29.1–67.0 kJ mol – 1. Parameter Rn25 ranged from 0.6–1.4 µmol m – 2 s – 1 and ΔHa(Rn) ranged from 47.4–95.4 kJ mol – 1. The stomatal coefficient ranged from 7.2–8.2. For the three evergreen trees, a single set of Vcmax25 and Rn25 parameters and temperature dependence curves produced satisfactory estimates of carbon uptake throughout the year, except during the period of simultaneous leaf fall and leaf expansion, which occurs in April and May. In the deciduous oak, declines in Vcmax25 were observed after summer, along with changes in Vcmax25 and Rn25 during the leaf expansion period. In all species, variation in m during periods of leaf expansion and drought should be considered in modeling studies. We conclude that the changes in normalized gas exchange parameters during periods of leaf expansion and drought need to be considered when modeling carbon uptake of evergreen broad-leaved species.},

The dark respiration rate of leaves at the various heights was also studied. Relationships among gas exchange characteristics, and also with nitrogen content per unit leaf area and leaf dry matter per area were clearly detected, forming general equations representing the vertical profile of several important parameters related to gas exchange. Numerical analysis revealed that the vertical distribution of gas exchange parameters was well determined showing both larger carbon gain for the whole canopy and at the same time positive carbon gain for the leaves of the lowest layer. For correct estimation of gas exchange at both leaf and canopy scales using multi-layer models, it is essential to consider the vertical distribution of gas exchange parameters with proper scaling coefficients.},

Sections of sun leaves from a mature tree and from seedlings cultivated at ambient and elevated temperatures were heated to 42–53 C.

Widely used chlorophyll a fluorescence methods based on heat-induced rise of initial fluorescence emission, Fo, and decrease in the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence, Fv/Fm, were reassessed. Fv/Fm determined 24 h after heat treatment was the fluorescence parameter most suitable to assess the lethal temperature causing permanent tissue damage. Thermotolerance was underestimated when Fo and Fv/Fm were recorded immediately after the heat treatment. The limit of thermo-tolerance was between 50 and 53 C, only a few  C above peak leaf temperatures measured in situ. The absence of seasonal changes in thermo-tolerance and only marginal increases in thermo-tolerance of plants grown under elevated temperatures suggest little capacity for further heat acclimation. Heat-stress experiments with intact potted seedlings also revealed irreversible leaf damage at 51–53 C, but plants survived and developed new leaves during post-culture.},

Plants were cultivated in growth chambers at strongly elevated daytime temperature (39°C), combined with either close to natural (22°C) or elevated (32°C) nighttime temperatures. Under both growth regimes, the critical temperature for irreversible leaf damage, determined by changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence, was approximately 51°C. This is comparable to values found in F. insipida growing under natural ambient conditions and indicates a limited potential for heat tolerance acclimation of this tropical forest tree species.

Parameters of the photosynthesis vs CO2 response curve, nitrogen and chlorophyll contents were studied in Populus tremula, Tilia cordata and Corylus avellana leaves along a natural light gradient in the canopy. 2. In all species, leaf nitrogen content per unit area (Ns) declined with decreasing fractional transmission of photon flux density (Ksum), measured by a hemispheric photographic technique. However, the shape of the relationship between Ns and Ksum depended on species. Ns was almost linearly related to Ksum in the most light-demanding species P. tremula but this relationship was curved in two other species. Populus tremula possessed the largest values of Ns at given Ksum, while C. avellana, the most shade-tolerant species, had the lowest values of Ns. 3. Both the initial slope, characterizing the maximum carboxylation efficiency, and the plateau value, providing an estimate of the photosynthetic electron transport capacity, of the photosynthesis vs CO2 response curves, were linearly related to Ns and only minor differences were observed among the studied species. Leaf chlorophyll content per area was also related to Ns but the ratio of Chl/N increased substantially at low Ksum in the lower canopy. It was concluded that the partitioning of nitrogen between light harvesting, electron transport and carboxylation components of the photosynthetic apparatus may change with depth in the canopy as a result of a relative increase in the light-harvesting complexes in relation to the rest of the photosynthetic apparatus. 4. The interspecific differences in species’ photosynthetic potentials are mainly associated with different nitrogen distribution patterns along the canopy and in minor part with differences in nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic machinery.},

  abstract = {Southeast Asian tropical rain forests are among the world's most important biomes in terms of global carbon cycling; nevertheless, the impact of environmental factors on the ecosystem CO2 flux remains poorly understood. One-dimensional multilayer biosphere-atmosphere models such as soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models are promising tools for understanding how interactions between environmental factors and leaf-level physiological parameters might impact canopy-level CO2 exchange. To examine application of the SVAT model in tropical rain forests, which is expected to be difficult partly because of the complex canopy structure and large number of tree species, we measured vertical and horizontal variations in leaf-level physiological parameters and leaf area densities together with eddy covariance measurements using a canopy crane in a tropical rain forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. Despite differences in species and canopy positions, leaf nitrogen per unit area (Na) within the canopy could be one-dimensionally described as a linear function of height. Na also clearly explained the other leaf-level physiological parameters across species and canopy positions. Even though the leaf area density profile likely varies in this tropical forest, the SVAT model satisfactorily reproduced the eddy covariance measurements. Furthermore, the CO2 flux calculated on the assumption that Na measured in the upper canopy was distributed evenly throughout was almost the same as that taking the vertical gradient into consideration. These findings suggest that when reproducing the CO2 flux in tropical rain forests using the SVAT model, the leaf area density profile obtained from the leaf area index (LAI) measured at one point and leaf-level physiological properties measured across species in the upper canopy are sufficient.},

  abstract = {Abstract Phenotypic plasticity and developmental instability in leaf traits are common in oak species but the role of environmental factors is not well understood. To decipher possible correlations between different leaf traits and effects of the position of leaves within the tree canopy, we quantified the plasticity of three leaf traits of 30 trees of Quercus alba L., Quercus palustris Muench and Quercus velutina Lam. We hypothesized that trees could modify the shape of their leaves for better adaptation to the variable microclimate within the canopy. Our results demonstrated that the south and north outer leaves were significantly smaller, more lobed and denser than those situated in the inner canopy. The order of leaves on the branch accounted for the plasticity of leaf traits in Q. alba only. Plasticity of lobing in Q. alba and Q. velutina depended on the height of the trees. We detected fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in all three species, but the source of variation depended on branch position in Q. velutina only. FA was more pronounced in north-facing leaves. Plasticity of the leaf traits ranged from small to medium. Plasticity of leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA) depended on the branch position. However, the plasticity of lobation was not affected by the location of a branch within the tree canopy. Quercus alba and Q. palustris had similar plastic responses but the plasticity of Q. velutina was significantly smaller. We concluded that individual plants detect and cope with environmental stress through vegetative organ modification.},

  abstract = {Thermal macrophysiology is an established research field that has led to well-described patterns in the global structuring of climate adaptation and risk. However, since it was developed primarily in animals, we lack information on how general these patterns are across organisms. This is alarming if we are to understand how thermal tolerances are distributed globally, improve predictions of climate change, and mitigate effects. We approached this knowledge gap by compiling a geographically and taxonomically extensive database on plant heat and cold tolerances and used this dataset to test for thermal macrophysiological patterns and processes in plants. We found support for several expected patterns: Cold tolerances are more variable and exhibit steeper latitudinal clines and stronger relationships with local environmental temperatures than heat tolerances overall. Next, we disentangled the importance of local environments and evolutionary and biogeographic histories in generating these patterns. We found that all three processes have significantly contributed to variation in both heat and cold tolerances but that their relative importance differs. We also show that failure to simultaneously account for all three effects overestimates the importance of the included variable, challenging previous conclusions drawn from less comprehensive models. Our results are consistent with rare evolutionary innovations in cold acclimation ability structuring plant distributions across biomes. In contrast, plant heat tolerances vary mainly as a result of biogeographical processes and drift. Our results further highlight that all plants, particularly at mid-to-high latitudes and in their nonhardened state, will become increasingly vulnerable to ongoing climate change.},

  abstract = {In the field, leaves may face very different light intensities within the tree canopy. Leaves usually respond with light-induced morphological and photosynthetic changes, in a phenomenon known as phenotypic plasticity. Canopy light distribution, leaf anatomy, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and pigment composition were investigated in an olive (Olea europaea, cvs. Arbequina and Arbosana) orchard planted with a high-density system (1,250~trees~ha−1). Sampling was made from three canopy zones: a lower canopy ({$<$}1~m), a central one (1–2~m), and an upper one ({$>$}2~m). Light interception decreased significantly in the lower canopy when compared to the central and top ones. Leaf angle increased and photosynthetic rates and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) decreased significantly and progressively from the upper canopy to the central and the lower canopies. The largest leaf areas were found in the lower canopy, especially in the cultivar Arbequina. The palisade and spongy parenchyma were reduced in thickness in the lower canopy when compared to the upper one, in the former due to a decrease in the number of cell layers from three to two (clearly distinguishable in the light and fluorescence microscopy images). In both cultivars, the concentration of violaxanthin-cycle pigments and β-carotene was higher in the upper than in the lower canopy. Furthermore, the de-epoxidized forms zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin increased significantly in those leaves from the upper canopy, in parallel to the NPQ increases. In conclusion, olive leaves react with morphological and photosynthetic changes to within-crown light gradients. These results strengthen the idea of olive trees as “modular organisms” that adjust the modules morphology and physiology in response to light intensity.},

  abstract = {Niche differentiation is a key issue in the current debate on community assembly mechanisms. In highly diverse moist tropical forests, tree species sensitivity to canopy openness is thought to be a major axis in niche differentiation. In the past, the syndrome of traits driving the demographic trade-off involved in the niche-based theory of coexistence has always been established among species situated at the two extremities of the shade-tolerance gradient, even though most tropical tree species have intermediate light requirements. In addition, trait plasticity has seldom been linked to tropical tree species distribution along environmental gradients. This article examines covariations between leaf traits, whole-plant traits and niche parameters among 14 tree species with intermediate light requirements in French Guiana and across a range of canopy openness. Each functional trait measured under field conditions was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Niche differentiation was characterized in terms of spatial light gradient. We first examined covariations between functional traits then explored to what degree the median value and plasticity in functional traits could predict light niche characteristics at the sapling stage and the ontogenetic change in light availability estimated by adult stature. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was positively correlated with leaf life span (LLS); species with higher LMA and higher LLS displayed lower diameter growth rates (GRs) and lower responsiveness to canopy gap at both whole-plant and population levels. This proved that the relationships previously established over a broader range of species held true within the narrow range of the light requirements covered. Height GR plasticity accounted for 49\% of the variation in light niche optimum. LMA plasticity, unlike LLS plasticity, was significantly correlated with light niche breadth and adult stature. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the relevance of considering the phenotypic plasticity in functional traits in community ecology, particularly for quantifying breadth of species distribution over environmental gradients. Our findings did not support Hubbell's hypothesis of functional equivalence and suggest that even a rather subtle variation in forest canopy disturbance promotes the coexistence of tropical tree species.},

  abstract = {Leaf area and its spatial distribution are key canopy parameters needed to model the radiation regime within a forest and to compute the mass and energy exchange between a forest and the atmosphere. A much larger proportion of available net radiation is received at the forest floor in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests. The proportion of ecosystem water vapor exchange (λE) and sensible heat exchange from the forest floor is therefore expected to be larger in open-canopy forests than in closed-canopy forests.We used a combination of optical and canopy geometry measurements, and robust one- and three-dimensional models to evaluate the influence of canopy architecture and radiative transfer on estimates of carbon, water and energy exchange of a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forest. Three-dimensional model simulations showed that the average probability of diffuse and direct radiation transmittance to the forest floor was greater than if a random distribution of foliage had been assumed. Direct and diffuse radiation transmittance to the forest floor was 28 and 39\%, respectively, in the three-dimensional model simulations versus 23 and 31\%, respectively, in the one-dimensional model simulations. The assumption of randomly distributed foliage versus inclusion of clumping factors in a one-dimensional, multi-layer biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange model (CANVEG) had the greatest effect on simulated annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil evaporation. Assuming random distribution, NEE was 41\% lower, net photosynthesis 3\% lower, total λE 10\% lower, and soil evaporation 40\% lower. The same comparisons at LAI 5 showed a similar effect on annual NEE estimates (37\%) and λE (12\%), but a much larger effect on net photosynthesis (20\%), suggesting that, at low LAI, canopies are mostly sunlit, so that redistribution of light has little effect on net photosynthesis, whereas the effect on net photosynthesis is much greater at high LAIs.},

  abstract = {The survival of dipterocarp seedlings in the understorey of south-east Asian rain forests is limited by their ability to maintain a positive carbon balance. Photosynthesis during sunflecks is an important component of carbon gain. Field measurements demonstrated that Shorea leprosula seedlings in a rain forest understorey received a high proportion of daily photon flux density at temperatures supra-optimal for photosynthesis (72\% at ≥30 °C, 14\% at ≥35 °C). To investigate the effect of high temperatures on photosynthesis during sunflecks, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were made on seedlings grown in controlled environment conditions either, under uniform, saturating irradiance (approximately 539 µmol m−2 s−1) or, shade/fleck sequences (approximately 30 µmol m−2 s−1/approximately 525 µmol m−2 s−1) at two temperatures, 28 or 38 °C. The rate of light-saturated photosynthesis, under uniform irradiance, was inhibited by 40\% at 38 °C compared with 28 °C. However, during the shade/fleck sequence, photosynthesis was inhibited by 59\% at 38 °C compared with 28 °C. The greater inhibition of photosynthesis during the shade/fleck sequence, when compared with uniform irradiance, was driven by the lower efficiency of dynamic photosynthesis combined with lower steady-state rates of photosynthesis. These results suggest that, contrary to current dogma, sunfleck activity may not always result in significant carbon gain. This has important consequences for seedling regeneration processes in tropical forests as well as for leaves in other canopy positions where sunflecks make an important contribution to total photon flux density.},

  abstract = {• Transient lulls in air movement are rarely measured, but can cause leaf temperature to rise rapidly to critical levels. The high heat capacity of thick leaves can damp this rapid change in temperature. However, little is known about the extent to which increased leaf thickness can reduce thermal damage, or how thick leaves would need to be to have biological significance. We evaluated quantitatively the contribution of small increases in leaf thickness to the reduction in thermal damage during critically low wind speeds under desert conditions. • We employed a numerical model to investigate the effect of thickness relative to transpiration, absorptance and leaf size on damage avoidance. We used measured traits and thermotolerance thresholds of real leaves to calculate the leaf temperature response to naturally occurring variable low wind speed. • Our results demonstrated that an increase in thickness of only fractions of a millimetre can prevent excursions to damaging high temperatures. This damping effect of increased thickness was greatest when other means of reducing leaf temperature (transpiration, reflectance or reduced size) were lacking. • For perennial desert flora, we propose that increased leaf thickness is important in decreasing the incidence of extreme heat stress and, in some species, in enhancing long-term survival.},

  abstract = {Tropical plant species are expected to have high heat tolerance reflecting phenotypic adjustments to warm regions or their evolutionary adaptation history. However, tropical highland specialists adapted to the colder temperatures found in the highlands, where short and prostrated vegetation decouples plants from ambient conditions, could exhibit different upper thermal limits than those of their lowland counterparts. Here we evaluated leaf heat tolerance of 21 tropical alpine paramo species to determine: 1) whether species with restricted distribution (i.e., highland specialists) have lower heat tolerance and are more vulnerable to warming than species with widespread distribution; 2) whether different growth forms have different heat tolerance; and 3) whether species height (i.e., microhabitat) influences its heat tolerance. We quantified heat tolerance by evaluating T50, which is the temperature that causes a reduction in 50\% of initial Fv/Fm values and reflects an irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Additionally, we estimated the thermal safety margins as the difference between T50 and the maximum leaf temperature registered for the species. All species presented high T50 values ranging between 45.4°C and 53.9°C, similar to those found for tropical lowland species. Heat tolerance was not correlated with species distributions or plant height, but showed a strong relationship with growth form, with rosettes having the highest heat tolerance. Thermal safety margins ranged from 12.1 to 31.0°C. High heat tolerance and broad thermal safety margins suggest low vulnerability of paramo species to warming as long as plants are capable of regulating the leaf temperature within this threshold. Whether paramo plants would be able to regulate leaf temperature if drought episodes become more frequent and transpirational cooling is compromised is the next question that needs to be answered.},

  abstract = {Forest canopies play a major role in biosphere—atmosphere interaction. Their actual temperature may deviate substantially from ambient atmospheric conditions as reported by weather stations. While there is a long tradition of false-colour imagery, new digital technologies in combination with IR transmission lenses and autocalibration routines permit unprecedented insight into the actual temperature regimes in canopies. We report canopy leaf temperature distribution over space and time assessed over a 35m tall mixed deciduous forest in NW Switzerland by means of a construction crane and a high resolution thermal camera. At an air temperature of 25°C, conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylverstris and Larix decidua) and deciduous broad-leaved trees with exceptionally high transpiration (Quercus petraea) or very open, low density canopies (Prunus avium) exhibited mean canopy leaf temperatures close to air temperature (0.3–2.7K above ambient) and the maximum amplitude within a given crown reached 6–9K. In contrast, broad-leaved deciduous species with dense canopies (Fagus sylvatica, Carpinus betulus and Tilia platyphyllos) were 4.5–5K warmer than air temperature and showed within canopy temperature amplitudes of 10–12K. Calculated leaf boundary resistance was clearly lower for conifers (3–24ms−1) than for broad-leaved trees (33–64ms−1). The study illustrates that mean leaf temperatures in forest trees are not adequately explained by either stomatal conductance or leaf dimensions, but strongly depend on canopy architecture (leaf area density, branching habits) in combination with leaf traits. Aerodynamic leaf and canopy characteristics lead to strongly enhanced vapour pressure gradients (evaporative forcing) and leaf temperatures vary enormously over short distances, calling for statistical temperature models (frequency distribution) rather than the use of means in any flux calculations. The presence/absence of certain tree taxa plays a key role in forest surface temperature.},

Since reflectance spectra are influenced by trichome density, and trichome density displays a considerable phenotypic plasticity, we asked whether this structural parameter could be a source of variation in the values of the most commonly used indices. • Trichome density was manipulated in detached leaves of three species having either peltate (Olea europaea and Elaeagnus angustifolius) or tubular (Populus alba) trichomes by successive removal of hairs. After each dehairing step, trichome density was determined by light or scanning electron microscopy and reflectance spectra were obtained with a diode-array spectrometer. • Although species-specific differences were evident, most of the indices were considerably affected even at low trichome densities. In general, the less-affected indices were those using wavebands within the visible spectral region. The index that could be safely used even at very high hair densities in all species was the red edge index (λRE) for chlorophyll. • The results indicate that changes in reflectance indices should be interpreted cautiously when concurrent changes in trichome density are suspected. In this case, the red edge for chlorophyll content may be the index of choice.},

Over a 25-m gradient from the canopy top to the lower canopy, mean light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points, and respiration rates declined in overstory Douglas-fir and western hemlock needles, paralleling a 65\% decline in the mean daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). At the canopy top, increasing light-saturated photosynthetic rates relative to lower canopy needles increased carbon uptake at high PPFD. In the lower canopy, reduced respiration rates relative to upper canopy needles increased carbon uptake at low PPFD by reducing the light compensation point. At all canopy positions, western hemlock had lower mean light-saturated photosynthetic rates, light compensation points and respiration rates than Douglas-fir. As a result, western hemlock had higher net photosynthetic rates at low PPFD, but lower net photosynthetic rates at high PPFD compared with Douglas-fir.},

The correlation between these three parameters and the receiving photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), however, was weaker. In Quercus ilex, trichome density and its UV-B absorbing capacity were considerably higher in the exposed, south-facing leaves, compared to the deeply shaded ones; the UV-B absorbing capacity of the de-haired lamina, however, was the same. In the broadleaved, alpine rosette of Verbascum speciosum, one could distinguish two areas on the leaves, one exposed and one shaded by the superimposed lamina. Although trichome density and the UV-B absorbing compounds of the de-haired leaf were the same in the two areas, the UV-B absorbing capacity of hairs was considerably increased in the exposed region. In V. speciosum, exposure induced also qualitative changes in the UV-B absorbance profile, apparently due to the formation of new flavonoid compounds absorbing maximally at 345-350 nm. In all other cases, the differences were mainly quantitative. The results support the postulate of a function of leaf hairs as a UV-B radiation screen and suggest that trichome density and/or its UV-B absorbing capacity may depend on irradiance during leaf development. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We sampled tree rings from 15 plots along a large altitudinal gradient in northeast China, and examined how climate gradient, forest type, height, tree size and density affect: (1) temporal growth variability [mean sensitivity (MS) and standard deviation (SD) of the chronologies], and (2) the relationship of ring width indices (RWI) with historical climate. We used BIC based model selection and variable importance to explore the major drivers of their altitudinal patterns. The results showed that: both growth variability and RWI-climate relationships changed significantly with altitude. Forest height was the most important predictor for altitudinal changes of MS and SD. For RWI-climate relationships, forest type was more important than climate gradient, while height and stem density were weak but necessary predictors. We showed that the altitudinal difference in growth response to climate change cannot be explained by climate gradient alone, and highlight the necessity to examine the influence of biotic factors (which covary with climate across geographic gradient) to better understand forest response to climate change.},

The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

Leaf WUE and its variability and dependencies were assessed using leaf gas-exchange measurements obtained during two growing seasons, 1999 and 2000, at the Soroe beech forest study site on Zealand in Denmark. It was found that the VPD-normalized leaf WUE, WUEnormleaf, although dependent on incoming PAR below 500μmolm−2s−1 is independent, both of the canopy levels and of variations in the environmental parameters. The average WUEnormleaf for PAR above 500μmolm−2s−1 was found to be 5.5μmol CO2 (mmol H2O)−1 hPa and, for the full range, 2.3μmol CO2 (mmol H2O)−1hPa. These results showed that WUE can be up-scaled from leaf to canopy on the basis of WUEnormleaf and the PAR distribution within the canopy. The up-scaling conducted was based on this WUEnormleaf – PAR relationship, the light distribution being assessed using the MAESTRA model, parameterized in accordance with measurements obtained for the Soroe forest. The up-scaled WUE was then compared with WUE as estimated from turbulent flux data measured above the forest with the eddy-covariance technique. The modeled daily canopy WUE obtained for daytime fluxes (6:00 AM–6:00 PM) was found to be in agreement with corresponding canopy WUE estimates based on the turbulent fluxes observed and to be dependent on VDP and light intensity alone, its thus being independent of other environmental factors. Accordingly, canopy WUE can be estimated on the basis of the up-scaled WUE relationships, provided incident PAR and VPD within the canopy are known.},

  abstract = {Gross primary production (GPP) in forests is the most important carbon flux in terrestrial ecosystems. Forest ecosystems with high leaf area index (LAI) values have diverse species or complex forest structures with vertical stratifications that influence the carbon\&ndash;water\&ndash;energy cycles. In this study, we used three light use efficiency (LUE) GPP models and site-level experiment data to analyze the effects of the vertical stratification of dense forest vegetation on the estimates of remotely sensed GPP during the growing season of two forest sites in East Asia: Dinghushan (DHS) and Tomakomai (TMK). The results showed that different controlling environmental factors of the vertical layers, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), produce different responses for the same LUE value in the different sub-ecosystems (defined as the tree, shrub, and grass layers), which influences the GPP estimation. Air temperature and VPD play important roles in the effects of vertical stratification on the GPP estimates in dense forests, which led to differences in GPP uncertainties from \&minus;50\% to 30\% because of the distinct temperature responses in TMK. The unequal vertical LAI distributions in the different sub-ecosystems led to GPP variations of 1\&ndash;2 gC/m2/day with uncertainties of approximately \&minus;30\% to 20\% because sub-ecosystems have unique absorbed fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and LUE. A comparison with the flux tower-based GPP data indicated that the GPP estimations from the LUE and APAR values from separate vertical layers exhibited better model performance than those calculated using the single-layer method, with 10\% less bias in DHS and more than 70\% less bias in TMK. The precision of the estimated GPP in regions with thick understory vegetation could be effectively improved by considering the vertical variations in environmental parameters and the LAI values of different sub-ecosystems as separate factors when calculating the GPP of different components. Our results provide useful insight that can be used to improve the accuracy of remote sensing GPP estimations by considering vertical stratification parameters along with the LAI of sub-ecosystems in dense forests.},

A standardized major axis (SMA) method was used to scale the mass-based trait relationships. We found that Amass, Parea, Pmass, and SLA were higher in the small individuals than in the large trees, but the changes of Aarea, Narea and Nmass leveled off. Trait pairs of Nmass~−~Amass, SLA~−~Amass and Nmass~−~SLA were positively correlated with slopes in common, but the y-intercept of SLA~−~Nmass was higher in the large trees than in the small individuals, indicating large trees had a higher N investment at a given SLA. In the pairs of Nmass~−~Amass and SLA~−~Amass, small individuals were shifted upwards along a common slope than large trees, corresponding to their large Amass and SLA. At a given SLA, the upwards shift along a common slope of small individuals does not mean that they have higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) than large trees, since a common slope and homogenous elevations of SLA-PNUE were found between them. Trait pairs of Pmass~−~Amass and Nmass~−~Pmass were positively correlated and the slopes differed between small and large trees. The slope of Pmass~−~Amass was steeper in the large than in the small individuals, suggesting large trees would have~a~disproportionally larger return with the same increase in Pmass. However, the pattern of slope of Nmass~−~Pmass was the reverse of that observed for Pmass~−~Amass, indicating a higher N/P ratio in the large than in the small individuals. At a given SLA, large trees had higher photosynthetic phosphorus use efficiency (PPUE) than small individuals, corresponding to their higher elevation of SLA-PPUE. In conclusion, leaf trait relationships can be modified by plant size but the positive correlations among SLA, Nmass, Pmass and Amass generally remain invariant.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Forest overstory and understory layers differ in carbon and water cycle regimes and phenology, as well as ecosystem functions. Separate retrievals of leaf area index (LAI) for these two layers would help to improve modeling forest biogeochemical cycles, evaluating forest ecosystem functions and also remote sensing of forest canopies by inversion of canopy reflectance models. In this paper, overstory and understory LAI values were estimated separately for global needleleaf and deciduous broadleaf forests by fusing MISR and MODIS observations. Monthly forest understory LAI was retrieved from the forest understory reflectivity estimated using MISR data. After correcting for the background contribution using monthly mean forest understory reflectivities, the forest overstory LAI was estimated from MODIS observations. The results demonstrate that the largest extent of forest understory vegetation is present in the boreal forest zones at northern latitudes. Significant seasonal variations occur for understory vegetation in these zones with LAI values up to 2–3 from June to August. The mean proportion of understory LAI to total LAI is greater than 30 \%. Higher understory LAI values are found in needleleaf forests (with a mean value of 1.06 for evergreen needleleaf forests and 1.04 for deciduous needleleaf forests) than in deciduous broadleaf forests (0.96) due to the more clumped foliage and easier penetration of light to the forest floor in needleleaf forests. Spatially and seasonally variable forest understory reflectivity helps to account for the effects of the forest background on LAI retrieval while compared with constant forest background. The retrieved forest overstory and understory LAI values were compared with an existing dataset for larch forests in eastern Siberia (40–75° N, 45–180° E). The retrieved overstory and understory LAI is close to that of the existing dataset, with an absolute error of 0.02 (0.06), relative error of 1.3 \% (14.3 \%) and RMSE of 0.93 (0.29) for overstory (understory). The comparisons between our results and field measurements in eight forest sites show that the \emph{R}\textsuperscript{2} values are 0.52 and 0.62, and the RMSEs are 1.36 and 0.62 for overstory and understory LAI, respectively.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

During the experimental period between 2012 and 2014, the mean average photosynthetic rates (Asat) under saturating light for Schima superba, Machilus breviflora, Pinus massoniana and Ardisia lindleyana in the warm site were7\%, 19\%, 20\% and 29\% higher than those in the control site. In contrast, seasonal Asat for Castanopsis hystrix in the warm site were lower compared to the control site. Changes in Asat in response to translocation were mainly associated with those in leaf stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic capacity (RuBP carboxylation, RuBP regeneration capacity). Our results imply that climate warming could have potential impacts on species composition and community structure in subtropical forests.},

Our model suggests that although reductions in photosynthetic rate at leaf temperatures (TL) above 30°C may occur, these are almost entirely accountable for in terms of reductions in stomatal conductance in response to higher leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficits D. This is as opposed to direct effects of TL on photosynthetic metabolism. We also find that increases in photosynthetic rates associated with increases in ambient [CO2] over forthcoming decades should more than offset any decline in photosynthetic productivity due to higher D or TL or increased autotrophic respiration rates as a consequence of higher tissue temperatures. We also find little direct evidence that tropical forests should not be able to respond to increases in [CO2] and argue that the magnitude and pattern of increases in forest dynamics across Amazonia observed over the last few decades are consistent with a [CO2]-induced stimulation of tree growth.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Vertical profiles in leaf mass per unit leaf area (MA), foliar 13C composition (δ13C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C) and major cation concentrations were estimated for 204 rain forest trees growing in 57 sites across the Amazon Basin. Data was analysed using a multilevel modelling approach, allowing a separation of gradients within individual tree canopies (within-tree gradients) as opposed to stand level gradients occurring because of systematic differences occurring between different trees of different heights (between-tree gradients). Significant positive within-tree gradients (i.e. increasing values with increasing sampling height) were observed for MA and [C]DW (the subscript denoting on a dry weight basis) with negative within-tree gradients observed for δ13C, [Mg]DW and [K]DW. No significant within-tree gradients were observed for [N]DW, [P]DW or [Ca]DW. The magnitudes of between-tree gradients were not significantly different to the within-tree gradients for MA, δ13C, [C]DW, [K]DW, [N]DW, [P]DW and [Ca]DW. But for [Mg]DW, although there was no systematic difference observed between trees of different heights, strongly negative within-tree gradients were found to occur.  When expressed on a leaf area basis (denoted by the subscript "A"), significant positive gradients were observed for [N]A, [P]A and [K]A both within and between trees, these being attributable to the positive intra- and between-tree gradients in MA mentioned above. No systematic within-tree gradient was observed for either [Ca]A or [Mg]A, but with a significant positive gradient observed for [Mg]A between trees (i.e. with taller trees tending to have a higher Mg per unit leaf area).  Significant differences in within-tree gradients between individuals were observed only for MA, δ13C and [P] A. This was best associated with the overall average [P]A for each tree, this also being considered to be a surrogate for a tree's average leaf area based photosynthetic capacity, Amax. A new model is presented which is in agreement with the above observations. The model predicts that trees characterised by a low upper canopy Amax should have shallow, or even non-existent, within-canopy gradients in Amax, with optimal intra-canopy gradients becoming sharper as a tree's upper canopy Amax increases. Nevertheless, in all cases it is predicted that the optimal within-canopy gradient in Amax should be substantially less than for photon irradiance. Although this is also shown to be consistent with numerous observations as illustrated by a literature survey of gradients in photosynthetic capacity for broadleaf trees, it is also in contrast to previously held notions of optimality. A new equation relating gradients in photosynthetic capacity within broadleaf tree canopies to the photosynthetic capacity of their upper canopy leaves is presented.},

  abstract = {The unique terrain, geography, and climate patterns of the eastern United States encourage periodic occurrences of catastrophic ice storms capable of large-scale damage or destruction of forests. However, the pervasive and persistent effects of these glaze events on regional forest distribution and composition have rarely been studied. In the southeastern US, ice storm frequency and intensity increase with increasing latitude and along the complex gradients from the coast (low, flat, sediment controlled and temperature moderated near the ocean) to the interior (high, rugged, bedrock controlled, distant from warming ocean). To investigate the potential influence of this disturbance gradient on regional forest composition, we studied the differential responses of trees (canopy position, lifeform group, and species group) to a particularly severe ice storm. Our results indicated that tree mortality and damage (canopy damage, bent bole, snapped bole, and uprooted) varied significantly between overstory and understory trees, and among species and lifeform groups. Overstory trees were more prone to glaze damage than understory trees, and evergreen broadleaf species were the most susceptible to glaze damage, while deciduous species were the least susceptible. Among the pine species studied, slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) and longleaf pine (P. palustris Mill.) suffered more severe damage and mortality than loblolly pine (P. taeda L.). Further, ice damage was correlated with distribution-based differences in injury susceptibility among pine and deciduous tree species. The most ice storm-tolerant pine species, loblolly pine, had the most northerly distribution (39.51°N), while the least resistant species were those with more southerly distribution (e.g., 33.29°N for slash pine). These results support hypotheses that the distributions of evergreen tree species are regulated by periodic catastrophic ice storms. Therefore, predicting future distributions of tree species in response to climate change should consider the role of ice storms in shaping the forest composition.},

  abstract = {It was predicted that relationships of leaf mass per area (LMA) with juvenile shade tolerance will depend on leaf habit, and on whether species are compared at a common age as young seedlings, or at a common size as saplings. A meta-analysis of 47 comparative studies (372 species) was used to test predictions, and the effect of light environment on this relationship. The LMA of evergreens was positively correlated with shade tolerance, irrespective of ontogeny or light environment. The LMA of young seedlings (≤ 1 yr) of deciduous species in low light was also positively correlated with shade tolerance; more weakly so in high light. By contrast, size-specific comparisons of deciduous saplings gave negative correlations of LMA with shade tolerance. Independent contrasts and cross-species analyses yielded broadly similar results. We conclude that ontogeny strongly influences the relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous trees, but has little impact on that of evergreens. Size-specific comparisons reveal opposing trends in deciduous and evergreen taxa: the negative relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous species is probably dominated by interspecific differences in palisade thickness, whereas patterns in evergreens are probably shaped more by the degree of structural reinforcement, linked to wide variation in leaf lifespan.},

  abstract = {Climate strongly influences ecological patterns and processes at scales ranging from local to global. Studies of ecological responses to climate usually rely on data derived from weather stations, where temperature and humidity may differ substantially from that in the microenvironments in which organisms reside. To help remedy this, we present a model that leverages first principles physics to predict microclimate above, within, and below the canopy in any terrestrial location on earth, made freely available as an R software package. The model can be run in one of two modes. In the first, heat and vapour exchange within and below canopy are modelled as transient processes, thus accounting for fine temporal-resolution changes. In the second, steady-state conditions are assumed, enabling conditions at hourly intervals or longer to be estimated with greater computational efficiency. We validated both modes of the model with empirical below-canopy thermal measurements from several locations globally, resulting in hourly predictions with mean absolute error of 2.77~°C and 2.79~°C for the transient and steady-state modes respectively. Alongside the microclimate model, several functions are provided to assist data assimilation, as well as different parameterizations to capture a variety of habitats, allowing flexible application even when little is known about the study location. The model's modular design in a programming language familiar to ecological researchers provides easy access to the modelling of site-specific climate forcing, in an attempt to more closely unify the fields of micrometeorology and ecology.},

  abstract = {Functional traits respond to environmental drivers, hence evaluating trait-environment relationships across spatial environmental gradients can help to understand how multiple drivers influence plant communities. Global-change drivers such as changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition occur worldwide, but affect community trait distributions at the local scale, where resources (e.g. light availability) and conditions (e.g. soil pH) also influence plant communities. We investigate how multiple environmental drivers affect community trait responses related to resource acquisition (plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), woodiness, and mycorrhizal status) and regeneration (seed mass, lateral spread) of European temperate deciduous forest understoreys. We sampled understorey communities and derived trait responses across spatial gradients of global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and past land use), while integrating in-situ plot measurements on resources and conditions (soil type, Olsen phosphorus (P), Ellenberg soil moisture, light, litter mass, and litter quality). Among the global-change drivers, mean annual temperature strongly influenced traits related to resource acquisition. Higher temperatures were associated with taller understoreys producing leaves with lower SLA, and a higher proportional cover of woody and obligate mycorrhizal (OM) species. Communities in plots with higher Ellenberg soil moisture content had smaller seeds and lower proportional cover of woody and OM species. Finally, plots with thicker litter layers hosted taller understoreys with larger seeds and a higher proportional cover of OM species. Our findings suggest potential community shifts in temperate forest understoreys with global warming, and highlight the importance of local resources and conditions as well as global-change drivers for community trait variation.},

  abstract = {The transpiration of a mature beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest was measured over a whole season by the heat pulse velocity technique and the results analysed in terms of a new analytical canopy conductance model, which takes into account the effects of partial decoupling from the atmosphere on the local humidity environment experienced by the canopy. Stand daily transpiration ranged from 0·62 to 2·97 mm d–1, with a seasonal mean value of 1·97 mm d–1. Maximum canopy conductance was 18·5 mm s–1, with a mean estimated value of 5·0 mm s–1; computed values were little affected by the assumption of neutral atmospheric conditions. The decoupling coefficient Ω varied greatly on a daily and seasonal basis, with an average value of 0·28. As a result of partial decoupling, the estimated vapour pressure deficit at the notional canopy surface exceeded the values measured above the canopy by 380 Pa on average. When correctly expressed in terms of humidity at the canopy surface, the model explained 80\% of the variance in half-hourly transpiration measurements. Upon cross-validation it still explained 72\% of the variance, as compared to only 40\% when correction for partial decoupling was not introduced. A baseline canopy conductance of 0·7 mm s–1, not modulated by the environment, was estimated. The implications of the model are discussed for the representation of canopy conductance and transpiration of broad-leaf forests.},

We asked whether carbon reserves decrease in resource stressed seedlings, and if NSC allocation is related to species' relative stress tolerances. We tested the effects of stress (shade, drought, and defoliation) on NSC in seedlings of five temperate tree species (Acer rubrum  Marsh., Betula papyrifera  Marsh., Fraxinus americana  L ., Quercus rubra  L., and Quercus velutina  Lam.). In a greenhouse experiment, seedlings were subjected to combinations of shade, drought, and defoliation. We harvested seedlings over 32–97~days and measured biomass and NSC concentrations in stems and roots to estimate depletion rates. For all species and treatments, except for defoliation, seedling growth and NSC accumulation ceased. Shade and drought combined caused total NSC decreases in all species. For shade or drought alone, only some species experienced decreases. Starch followed similar patterns as total NSC, but soluble sugars increased under drought for drought‐tolerant species. These results provide evidence that species deplete stored carbon in response to carbon limiting stress and that species differences in NSC response may be important for understanding carbon depletion as a buffer against shade‐ and drought‐induced mortality.},

  abstract = {Information on understory composition and its relationships with the overstory tree canopy, especially leaf area index (LAI), is crucially needed in, e.g., modeling land-atmosphere interactions and productivity of forests. There are also several global LAI products produced from satellite data which need to be validated with ground reference data. However, to date, only scarce field data on simultaneous structural properties of under- and overstory vegetation, and tree canopy LAI, have been available in boreal forests. This paper shows how understory composition and fractional cover of different species types varies in a boreal forest site, and how it is linked to structural properties of the tree layer. The study is based on 301 understory plots collected in an area of ∼16 km2 around Hyytiälä forestry field station, Finland (61°50′N, 24°17′E) in a southern boreal forest site. Forest understory plot data was accompanied with measurements of both standard forest inventory variables and optically-based canopy light transmittance data. Clear differences in average species composition between different site fertility types were observed, but also large variation within each site fertility type was noted. Forest understory composition was better correlated with structural forest canopy measures (e.g., tree canopy LAI, canopy cover, canopy openness) than with traditional forest inventory variables such as tree height or diameter. Forest canopy LAI and the fractional cover of understory were strongly related, especially in more fertile sites. Our results highlight the role of tree canopy structural metrics as modifiers of the understory light climate and growing conditions, also, in boreal forests.},

In four of the six species the PI of leaf traits varied within species, and in four of the ten leaf traits assessed, the PI differed between species. The greatest PI values were found for stomatal density (Ds) and CO2-saturated photosynthesis, and the lowest ones were found for stomatal size, and leaf thickness. Despite the differences in PI values within species, the mean PI was similar in all the six species. As the saplings grow toward the canopy, the strategy to increase carbon uptake involves increasing Ds and leaf nitrogen and reducing stomatal size.},

We studied sun–shade plasticity of 24 leaf traits of 43 tree species in a Bolivian dry deciduous forest. Sampling was confined to small trees. For each species, leaves were taken from five of the most and five of the least illuminated crowns. Trees were selected based on the percentage of the hemisphere uncovered by other crowns. We examined leaf trait variation and the relation between trait plasticity and light demand, maximum adult stature, and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure of the species. Leaf trait variation was mainly related to differences among species and to a minor extent to differences in light availability. Traits related to the palisade layer, thickness of the outer cell wall, and Narea and Parea had the greatest plasticity, suggesting their importance for leaf function in different light environments. Short-lived pioneers had the highest trait plasticity. Overall plasticity was modest and rarely associated with juvenile light requirements, adult stature, or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Dry forest tree species had a lower light-related plasticity than wet forest species, probably because wet forests cast deeper shade. In dry forests light availability may be less limiting, and low water availability may constrain leaf trait plasticity in response to irradiance.},

SLA describes the efficiency with which the leaf captures light relative to the biomass invested in the leaf. It increases from top to bottom of a canopy, but it is unclear why. We sampled stands with low and ele- vated canopies (young and old stands) to determine whether SLA is related to water potential, as inferred from branch height and length, or shade, as inferred from branch position relative to the rest of the canopy, or both. We studied western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. \& C. Laws.), and interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca) in northern Idaho. SLA decreased with branch height (P {$<$} 0.0001) at rates that varied among species (P {$<$} 0.0001). Branch length had no influence on SLA (P = 0.85). We detected no differences with canopy elevation (P = 0.90), but the slopes of lines relating SLA to branch height may have differed between the canopy elevation classes (P = 0.039). The results are consistent with predictions based on the hypothesis that SLA decreases as the gravitational component of water potential falls. The lack of a strong shading effect simplifies the estimation of canopy SLA for process models, requiring only species and branch heights.},

  abstract = {We used three methods to measure boundary layer conductance to heat transfer (gbH) and water vapor transfer (gbV) in foliated branches of Abies amabilis Dougl. ex J. Forbes, a subalpine forest tree that produces clumped shoot morphology on sun-formed branches. Boundary layer conductances estimated in the field from energy balance measurements increased linearly from approximately 10 mm s−1 at low wind speeds ({$<$} 0.1 m s−1) to over 150 mm s−1 at wind speeds of 2.0 m s−1. Boundary layer conductances measured on shoot models in a wind tunnel were consistently higher than field measurements. The difference between wind tunnel values and field measurements was attributable to variation in path length between the two experimental environments. Boundary layer conductance estimated by subtracting stomatal resistance (rsV) measured with a porometer from the total branch vapor phase resistance were unusually small. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this method is not suitable for coniferous foliage or when stomatal conductance (gsV) is small compared with gbV. Analysis of the relative magnitudes of gsV and gbV revealed that, under most conditions, A. amabilis branches are well coupled (i.e., gsV is the dominant controller of transpiration). The boundary layer conductance to heat transfer is small enough that leaf temperature can become substantially higher than air temperature when radiation is high and wind speed is low. Over a two-month period, the maximum difference between leaf and air temperatures exceeded 6 °C. Leaf temperature exceeded air temperature by more than 2 °C on 10\% of the daylight hours during this period. Consideration of both the photosynthetic temperature response of A. amabilis foliage as well as the summer air temperature conditions in its habitat suggests that these elevated leaf temperatures do not have a significant impact on carbon gain during the growing season.},

  abstract = {Foliar trait adaptation to sun and shade has been extensively studied in the context of photosynthetic performance of plants, focusing on nitrogen allocation, light capture and use via chlorophyll pigments and leaf morphology; however, less is known about the potential sun-shade dichotomy of other functionally important foliar traits. In this study, we measured 19 traits in paired sun and shade leaves along a 3,500-m elevation gradient in southern Peru to test whether the traits differ with canopy position, and to assess if relative differences vary with species composition and/or environmental filters. We found significant sun-shade differences in leaf mass per area (LMA), photosynthetic pigments (Chl ab and Car), and d13C. Sun-shade offsets among these traits remained constant with elevation, soil substrates, and species compositional changes. However, other foliar traits related to structure and chemical defense, and those defining general metabolic processes, did not differ with canopy position. Our results suggest that whole-canopy function is captured in many traits of sun leaves; however, photosynthesis-related traits must be scaled based on canopy light extinction. These findings show that top-of-canopy measurements of foliar chemistry from spectral remote sensing approaches map directly to whole-canopy foliar traits including shaded leaves that cannot be directly observed from above.},

  abstract = {It has long been held that the low photosynthetic rates (A) of coffee leaves are largely associated with diffusive constraints to photosynthesis. However, the relative limitations of the stomata and mesophyll to the overall diffusional constraints to photosynthesis, as well as the coordination of leaf hydraulics with photosynthetic limitations, remain to be fully elucidated in coffee. Whether the low actual A under ambient CO2 concentrations is associated with the kinetic properties of Rubisco and high (photo)respiration rates also remains elusive. Here, we provide a holistic analysis to understand the causes associated with low A by measuring a variety of key anatomical/hydraulic and photosynthetic traits in sun- and shade-grown coffee plants. We demonstrate that leaf hydraulic architecture imposes a major constraint on the maximisation of the photosynthetic gas exchange of coffee leaves. Regardless of the light treatments, A was mainly limited by stomatal factors followed by similar limitations associated with the mesophyll and biochemical constraints. No evidence of an inefficient Rubisco was found; rather, we propose that coffee Rubisco is well tuned for operating at low chloroplastic CO2 concentrations. Finally, we contend that large diffusive resistance should lead to large CO2 drawdown from the intercellular airspaces to the sites of carboxylation, thus favouring the occurrence of relatively high photorespiration rates, which ultimately leads to further limitations to A.},

  abstract = {In a context of urban warming, the effects of trees on outdoor thermal stress are important even during the increasingly hot autumn season. This study examines the effects of a deciduous tree species (Tilia x europaea L) on surface temperature over different ground materials and in turn on human thermal comfort, with a particular focus on tree shade variation due to leaf fall. Grass, asphalt, and gravel-covered ground surfaces, both sun-exposed and under the Tilia, were monitored in Florence, Italy, during the summer (2014) and autumn (2017) seasons. The Index of Thermal Stress (ITS) was used to gauge the micrometeorological effects of the changing tree canopy, with tree defoliation quantified by the Plant Area Index. On clear summer days, thermal discomfort was especially pronounced over exposed asphalt, and even more intense above exposed gravel due to its higher reflectivity-while shaded surfaces showed large reductions in thermal stress. Even though incoming solar radiation decreases over the course of the fall season, the direct radiation under the gradually defoliating tree canopy actually increases. Due to this diminished shading effect, the differences in surface temperature between exposed and shaded asphalt shrink dramatically from about 20 to 3~°C. However, since ambient conditions become milder as the season progresses, the Tilia demonstrated a double benefit in terms of ITS: providing thermal comfort under its full canopy at the beginning of autumn and maintaining comfort even as its canopy thins out. At the same time, tree species with earlier defoliation may be unable to replicate such benefits.},

  abstract = {A survey of photosynthetic pigments, including 86 species from 64 families, was conducted for leaves of neotropical vascular plants to study sun-shade patterns in carotenoid biosynthesis and occurrence of α-carotene (α-Car) and lutein epoxide (Lx). Under low light, leaves invested less in structural components and more in light harvesting, as manifested by low leaf dry mass per area (LMA) and enhanced mass-based accumulation of chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids, especially lutein and neoxanthin. Under high irradiance, LMA was greater and β-carotene (β-Car) and violaxanthin-cycle pool increased on a leaf area or Chl basis. The majority of plants contained α-Car in leaves, but the α- to β-Car ratio was always low in the sun, suggesting preference for β-Car in strong light. Shade and sun leaves had similar β,ε-carotenoid contents per unit Chl, whereas sun leaves had more β,β-carotenoids than shade leaves. Accumulation of Lx in leaves was found to be widely distributed among taxa: {$>$}5 mmol mol Chl−1 in 20\% of all species examined and {$>$}10 mmol mol Chl−1 in 10\% of woody species. In Virola elongata (Benth.) Warb, having substantial Lx in both leaf types, the Lx cycle was operating on a daily basis although Lx restoration in the dark was delayed compared with violaxanthin restoration.},

  abstract = {Tropical tree species have evolved under very narrow temperature ranges compared to temperate forest species. Studies suggest that tropical trees may be more vulnerable to continued warming compared to temperate species, as tropical trees have shown declines in growth and photosynthesis at elevated temperatures. However, regional and global vegetation models lack the data needed to accurately represent such physiological responses to increased temperatures, especially for tropical forests. To address this need, we compared instantaneous photosynthetic temperature responses of mature canopy foliage, leaf temperatures, and air temperatures across vertical canopy gradients in three forest types: tropical wet, tropical moist, and temperate deciduous. Temperatures at which maximum photosynthesis occurred were greater in the tropical forests canopies than the temperate canopy (30 ± 0.3 ◦C vs. 27 ± 0.4 ◦C). However, contrary to expectations that tropical species would be functioning closer to threshold temperatures, photosynthetic temperature optima was exceeded by maximum daily leaf temperatures, resulting in sub-optimal rates of carbon assimilation for much of the day, especially in upper canopy foliage ({$>$}10 m). If trees are unable to thermally acclimate to projected elevated temperatures, these forests may shift from net carbon sinks to sources, with potentially dire implications to climate feedbacks and forest community composition.},

  abstract = {The carbon isotope signature (δ13C) of foliar cellulose from sunlit tops of trees typically becomes enriched as trees of the same species in similar environments grow taller, indicative of size-related changes in leaf gas exchange. However, direct measurements of gas exchange in common environmental conditions do not always reveal size-related differences, even when there is a distinct size-related trend in δ13C of the very foliage used for the gas exchange measurements. Since δ13C of foliage predominately reflects gas exchange during spring when carbon is incorporated into leaf cellulose, this implies that gas exchange differences in different-sized trees are most likely to occur in favorable environmental conditions during spring. If gas exchange differs with tree size during wet but not dry conditions, then this further implies that environmental sensitivity of leaf gas exchange varies as a function of tree size. These implications are consistent with theoretical relationships among height, hydraulic conductance and gas exchange. We investigated the environmental sensitivity of gas exchange in different-sized Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) via a detailed process model that specifically incorporates size-related hydraulic conductance [soil–plant–atmosphere (SPA)], and empirical measurements from both wet and dry periods. SPA predicted, and the empirical measurements verified, that differences in gas exchange associated with tree size are greatest in wet and mild environmental conditions and minimal during drought. The results support the hypothesis that annual net carbon assimilation and transpiration of trees are limited by hydraulic capacity as tree size increases, even though at particular points in time there may be no difference in gas exchange between different-sized trees. Maximum net ecosystem exchange occurs in spring in Pacific Northwest forests; therefore, the presence of hydraulic limitations during this period may play a large role in carbon uptake differences with stand-age. The results also imply that the impacts of climate change on the growth and physiology of forest trees will vary depending on the age and size of the forest.},

  abstract = {As climate change drives increased drought in many forested regions, mechanistic understanding of the factors conferring drought tolerance in trees is increasingly important. The dendrochronological record provides a window through which we can understand how tree size and traits shape growth responses to droughts. We analyzed tree-ring records for 12 species in a broadleaf deciduous forest in Virginia (USA) to test hypotheses for how tree height, microenvironment characteristics, and species’ traits shaped drought responses across the three strongest regional droughts over a 60-yr period. Drought tolerance (resistance, recovery, and resilience) decreased with tree height, which was strongly correlated with exposure to higher solar radiation and evaporative demand. The potentially greater rooting volume of larger trees did not confer a resistance advantage, but marginally increased recovery and resilience, in sites with low topographic wetness index. Drought tolerance was greater among species whose leaves lost turgor (wilted) at more negative water potentials and experienced less shrinkage upon desiccation. The tree-ring record reveals that tree height and leaf drought tolerance traits influenced growth responses during and after significant droughts in the meteorological record. As climate change-induced droughts intensify, tall trees with drought-sensitive leaves will be most vulnerable to immediate and longer-term growth reductions.},

  abstract = {Tree growth is an important indicator of forest health, productivity, and demography. Knowing precisely how trees' grow within a year, instead of across years, can lead to a finer understanding of the mechanisms that drive these larger patterns. The growing use of dendrometer bands in research forests has only rarely been used to measure growth at resolutions finer than yearly, but intra-annual growth patterns can be observed from dendrometer bands using precision digital calipers and weekly measurements. Here we present a workflow to help forest ecologists fit growth models to intra-annual measurements using standard optimization functions provided by the R platform. We explain our protocol, test uncertainty in parameter estimates with respect to sample sizes, extend the optimization protocol to estimate robust lower and upper annual diameter bounds, and discuss potential challenges to optimal fits. We offer R code to implement this workflow. We found that starting values and initial optimization routines are critical to fitting the best functional forms. After using a bounded, broad search method, a more focused search algorithm obtained consistent results. To estimate starting and ending annual diameters, we combined the growth function with early and late estimates of beginning and ending growth. Once we fit the functions, we present extension algorithms that estimate periodic reductions in growth, total growth, and present a method of controlling for the shifting allocation to girth during the growth season. We demonstrate that with these extensions, an analysis of growth response to weather (e.g., the water available to a tree) can be derived in a way that is comparable across trees, years, and sites. Thus, this approach, when applied across broader data sets, offers a pathway to build inference about the effects of seasonal weather on growth, size- and light-dependent patterns of growth, species-specific patterns, and phenology.},

  abstract = {Drought disproportionately affects larger trees in tropical forests, but implications for forest composition and carbon (C) cycling in relation to dry season intensity remain poorly understood. In order to characterize how C cycling is shaped by tree size and drought adaptations and how these patterns relate to spatial and temporal variation in water deficit, we analyze data from three forest dynamics plots spanning a moisture gradient in Panama that have experienced El Niño droughts. At all sites, aboveground C cycle contributions peaked below 50-cm stem diameter, with stems ≥ 50 cm accounting for on average 59\% of live aboveground biomass, 45\% of woody productivity and 49\% of woody mortality. The dominance of drought-avoidance strategies increased interactively with stem diameter and dry season intensity. Although size-related C cycle contributions did not vary systematically across the moisture gradient under nondrought conditions, woody mortality of larger trees was disproportionately elevated under El Niño drought stress. Thus, large ({$>$} 50 cm) stems, which strongly mediate but do not necessarily dominate C cycling, have drought adaptations that compensate for their more challenging hydraulic environment, particularly in drier climates. However, these adaptations do not fully buffer the effects of severe drought, and increased large tree mortality dominates ecosystem-level drought responses.},

  abstract = {1 Leaf respiration is a major component of the terrestrial carbon cycle, but is poorly quantified for tropical forests. We measured dark respiration, R, and nutrient concentration (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) of leaves within two forest canopies: in Reserva Jarú, south-west Brazil; and Mbalmayo Reserve, central Cameroon. The data, expressed on a leaf area basis (Ra, Na, Pa) and a leaf mass basis (Rm, Nm, Pm), were used to quantify the temperature sensitivity of R and to test the hypothesis that leaf metabolism is more strongly constrained by phosphorus than by nitrogen in these lowland rainforests. 2 Leaf respiration rate (Ra, at 25 °C) at Jarú was nearly half that at Mbalmayo (the range in Ra from near the ground to the upper canopy was 0·11–0·78 µmol m−2 s−1 at Jarú versus 0·22–1·19 µmol m−2 s−1 at Mbalmayo), and the mean Q10 for respiration at each site was 2·3 ± 0·9 (1 SD) and 2·0 ± 0·5 (1 SD), respectively. There were significant differences (P {$<$} 0·01) between sites in leaf phosphorus concentration, but not in leaf nitrogen concentration: Pm was very low at Jarú (0·2–0·7 mg g−1) but higher at Mbalmayo (0·5–2·4 mg g−1), whilst Nm was similar at both forests (10–45 mg g−1). 3 Rm was not significantly associated with canopy position or specific leaf area (SLA, m2 g−1) in either forest, but a significant relationship between SLA and Nm was found for both sites (P {$<$} 0·05), consistent with existing data. At Jarú, Rm was strongly related to Pm (P {$<$} 0·001) and less strongly related to Nm (P {$<$} 0·05), but at Mbalmayo, Rm was not significantly related to either Pm or Nm. 4 Ra was linearly related to Na and Pa at both sites (P {$<$} 0·01), principally because of changes in leaf mass per area (LMA, g m−2) associated with canopy position. At Mbalmayo, LMA explained 70\% of the variation in Ra, but only 20\% at Jarú. For Jarú, the strongest relationship with Ra was obtained by combining LMA with Pm in a multiple regression (r2 = 0·53); further inclusion of Nm did not improve the regression. At Mbalmayo neither Nm or Pm improved the regression of Ra on LMA. 5 These results indicate a strong influence of LMA on the relative rates of Ra within the vertical gradient of each canopy. They also suggest that at JarúPm constrains respiration more strongly than Nm, and further, that the very low Pm at Jarú may explain the lower absolute values of respiration there relative to Mbalmayo, where Pm was higher. The leaves at both sites are typical of lowland tropical rainforests in not having particularly low Nm, and consistent with this, Nm was a weaker predictor of respiration than Pm or LMA.},

Median reductions in maximum daily air temperatures were 3.2°C in the 5-m wide and 3.4°C in the 30-m wide riparian forests as compared to maximum daily air temperatures in an adjacent treeless riparian area. Both forested sites had slightly warmer minimum daily air temperatures than those in the open site (median differences of 0.5°C for the 5-m and 0.7°C for the 30-m wide riparian forests). The 30-m buffer was slightly cooler than the 5-m buffer during the day (median difference in maximum daily air temperature of 0.3°C) and slightly warmer during the night (median difference in minimum daily air temperature of 0.4°C). Buffer performance in reducing the daily maximum temperature was most effective as the air temperature increased at the open site, whereas performance in reducing the minimum temperature increased as the air temperature declined.

The percentage cover of the understory layer was estimated at the same locations as light measurements. Mean \%PPFD varied from 2\% at the forest floor under Populus forests to 15\% above the understory vegetation cover under Betula forests. Percent PPFD above the understory vegetation cover was significantly higher under shade intolerant tree species such as Populus, Betula and Pinus than under shade tolerant conifers. No significant differences were found in \%PPFD above the understory vegetation cover under similar tree species between clay and till soil types. The coefficient of variation in \%PPFD measured in the nine locations within each stand was significantly lower under deciduous dominated forests (mean of 19\%) than under coniferous dominated forests (mean of 40\%). \%PPFD measured at the forest floor was positively correlated with \%PPFD measured above the understory vegetation and negatively correlated with cumulative total percent cover of the understory vegetation (R2 = 0.852).

  abstract = {Leaf thermoregulation has been documented in a handful of studies, but the generality and origins of this pattern are unclear. We suggest that leaf thermoregulation is widespread in both space and time, and originates from the optimization of leaf traits to maximize leaf carbon gain across and within variable environments. Here we use global data for leaf temperatures, traits and photosynthesis to evaluate predictions from a novel theory of thermoregulation that synthesizes energy budget and carbon economics theories. Our results reveal that variation in leaf temperatures and physiological performance are tightly linked to leaf traits and carbon economics. The theory, parameterized with global averaged leaf traits and microclimate, predicts a moderate level of leaf thermoregulation across a broad air temperature gradient. These predictions are supported by independent data for diverse taxa spanning a global air temperature range of ∼60\,°C. Moreover, our theory predicts that net carbon assimilation can be maximized by means of a trade­off between leaf thermal stability and photosynthetic stability. This prediction is supported by globally distributed data for leaf thermal and photosynthetic traits. Our results demonstrate that the temperatures of plant tissues, and not just air, are vital to developing more accurate Earth system models.},

We use plant leaves to show how energy budgets (i) provide a foundation for understanding thermoregulation, (ii) explain mechanisms driving trait variation across environmental gradients, and (iii) guide selection on functional traits via carbon economics. Although plants are often considered to be poikilotherms, the data suggest that they are instead limited homeotherms. Leaf functional traits that promote limited homeothermy are adaptive because homeothermy maximizes instantaneous and lifetime carbon gain. This theory provides a process-based foundation for trait–climate analyses and shows that future studies should consider plant (not only air) temperatures.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests have evolved under relatively narrow temperature regimes, and therefore may be more susceptible to climatic change than forests in higher latitudes. Recent evidence shows that lowland tropical forest canopies may already be exceeding thermal maxima for photosynthesis. Height can strongly influence both the microclimate and physiology of forest canopy foliage, yet vertical trends in canopy micrometeorology are rarely examined in tropical forests. To improve our understanding of how climatological and micrometeorological conditions affect tropical tree function, we assessed vertical gradients of photosynthetic photon flux density, vapor pressure deficit, air temperature, leaf temperature, and the difference between leaf and air temperature (ΔT) in a Puerto Rican tropical wet forest. Both air temperature and vapor pressure deficit increased linearly with height. Leaf temperature, however, did not significantly differ across the shaded foliage from 0-16 m, while the uppermost layer (20 m) was up to 4°C hotter than the rest of the foliage and up to 5°C hotter than air temperature at the highest radiation intensity. As a result, leaf temperatures in the shaded middle canopy and understory showed nearly poikilothermic behavior (i.e., leaf temperatures~=~air temperature), while the uppermost canopy strata showed megathermic behavior (i.e., leaf temperatures greater than air temperature), revealing different thermoregulation strategies for sun-lit versus shaded foliage. In addition, the uppermost canopy was the only stratum to exceed mean photosynthetic temperature optima for this site (Topt~=~30.2 ± 1.1°C). Because the upper canopy plays a disproportionately large role in whole-forest photosynthesis, continued warming could potentially weaken the tropics’ carbon sink capacity. However, the shaded leaves may be able increase carbon uptake with further warming because they appear to be able to maintain temperatures below photosynthetic optima, possibly with the help of radiation shielding provided by the uppermost canopy layer.},

  abstract = {Plant isoprene emissions have been linked to several reaction pathways involved in atmospheric photochemistry. Evidence exists from a limited set of past observations that isoprene emission rate (Is) decreases as a function of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that increased temperature suppresses the CO2 effect. We studied interactions between intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and temperature as they affect Is in field-grown hybrid poplar trees in one of the warmest climates on earth – the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States. We observed an unexpected midsummer downregulation of Is despite the persistence of relatively high temperatures. High temperature suppression of the Is:Ci relation occurred at all times during the growing season, but sensitivity of Is to increased Ci was greatest during the midsummer period when Is was lowest. We interpret the seasonal downregulation of Is and increased sensitivity of Is to Ci as being caused by weather changes associated with the onset of a regional monsoon system. Our observations on the temperature suppression of the Is:Ci relation are best explained by the existence of a small pool of chloroplastic inorganic phosphate, balanced by several large, connected metabolic fluxes, which together, determine the Ci and temperature dependencies of phosphoenolpyruvate import into the chloroplast.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Microclimatic variability in tropical forests plays a key role in shaping species distributions and their ability to cope with environmental change, especially for ectotherms. Yet, currently available climatic datasets lack data from the forest interior and our knowledge of thermal tolerance among tropical ectotherms is limited. To tackle this, we studied natural variation in the microclimate experienced by a tropical genus of butterflies (\emph{Heliconius} sp.) along their Andean range across a single year. We found that the forest strongly buffers temperature and humidity in the understory, especially in the lowlands where temperatures are more extreme. There were systematic differences between our yearly records and macroclimate databases (WorldClim2), with lower interpolated minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures higher than expected. We then assessed thermal tolerance of ten \emph{Heliconius} butterfly species in the wild and showed that populations at high elevations had significantly lower heat tolerance than those at lower elevations. However, when we reared populations of the widespread \emph{H. erato} from high and low elevations in a common-garden environment, the difference in heat tolerance across elevations was reduced, indicating plasticity in this trait. Microclimate buffering is not currently captured in publicly available datasets but could be crucial for enabling upland shifting of species sensitive to heat such as highland \emph{Heliconius}. Plasticity in thermal tolerance may alleviate the effects of global warming on some widespread ectotherm species, but more research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of plasticity on populations and species.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Summary statement{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Tropical forests along the Andes were found to greatly buffer climate.

The productivity and climate feedbacks of future tropical forests depend on the ability of trees to acclimate their physiological processes, such as leaf dark respiration (Rd), to these new conditions. However, knowledge on this is currently limited due to data scarcity. We studied the impact of growth temperature on Rd and its dependency on net photosynthesis (An), leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents, and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) in 16 early-successional (ES) and late-successional (LS) tropical tree species in multispecies plantations along an elevation gradient (Rwanda TREE project). Moreover, we explored the effect of drought on Rd in one ES and one LS species. Leaf Rd at 20°C decreased at warmer sites, regardless if it was expressed per unit leaf area, mass, N or P. This acclimation resulted in an 8\% and a 28\% decrease in Rd at prevailing nighttime temperatures in trees at the intermediate and warmest sites, respectively. Moreover, drought reduced Rd, particularly in the ES species and at the coolest site. Thermal acclimation of Rd is complete or overcompensatory and independent of changes in leaf nutrients or LMA in African tropical trees.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Drier climates predicted for many regions can result in reduced evaporative cooling leading to overheating of leaves and enhanced mortality. To what extent non-evaporative cooling can contribute to plant resilience to the increasingly stressful conditions is poorly known at present. Using a novel, high accuracy infrared system for continuous measurements of leaf temperature in mature trees under field conditions, we assessed leaf-to-air temperature differences ΔT\textsubscript{leaf-air} of pine needles during drought. ΔT\textsubscript{leaf-air} was weakly related to variations in the radiation load and wind speed, but highly dependent on canopy structure and within-canopy turbulence that enhance the sensible heat flux H. On mid-summer days, ΔT\textsubscript{leaf-air} remained around 2°C, both in trees exposed to summer drought, and in those provided with a supplement irrigation having a 10x higher transpiration rate. The non-evaporative cooling in the drought-exposed trees must be facilitated by low resistance to heat transfer generating large H. Non-evaporative cooling is demonstrated as an effective cooling mechanism in needle-leaf trees, which can be a critical factor in forest resistance to drying climates. The generation of large H at the leaf scale provides a basis for the development of the previously identified canopy-scale heat dissipation through the `convector effect9.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Midway through the summer, we transferred potted, shade-grown seedlings of four co-occurring temperature deciduous tree species representing a range of shade-tolerance categories and leaf production strategies to gaps. Shade-tolerant Acer saccharum was the least responsive to gap conditions. It produced few new, high-light acclimated leaves and increases in photosynthetic rates of shade-developed leaves appeared stomatally limited. Intermediately shade-tolerant Fraxinus americana and Quercus rubra responded most, by producing new leaves and increasing photosynthetic rates of existing shade-developed leaves to levels not significantly different from gap-grown controls within four weeks of gap exposure. Shade-intolerant Liriodendron tulipifera was intermediate in response. In these species, the degree of shoot-level morphological acclimation (new leaf production) and leaf-level physiological acclimation (photosynthetic increases in existing leaves) appear coupled. Mechanisms of acclimation also appear related to intrinsic patterns of nitrogen use and mobilization, the ability to adjust stomatal conductance, and shade tolerance.},

The short-term metabolic modulation after plant exposure to heat and cold, including chilling and freezing, is discussed. Effects on photosynthesis, cell membranes, antioxidant system, production of heat shock proteins and nitric oxide, as well as an overview of signaling events to heat or cold stress are presented. In addition, we also discuss the acclimation process that occurs when the plant acquires resistance to an increase or decrease in temperature, adjusting its homeostasis and steady-state physiology to the new temperatures. Finally, we present studies with tropical plants that aim at elucidating the effects of temperature and the identification of the resilience levels of these plants to the expected climate changes, and which seek the development of techniques for germplasm conservation of endangered species.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that in temperate deciduous trees acclimation to potentially damaging high irradiances occurs via long-term adjustments in foliar photosynthetic capacity, and short-term changes in xanthophyll cycle pool size in response to weather fluctuations, nitrogen concentration and pigment composition were examined along a canopy light gradient in three species –Betula pendula, Populus tremula and Tilia cordata (from most shade intolerant to tolerant), and foliage photosynthetic potentials in P. tremula and T. cordata. Integrated quantum flux density (Qi) incident on leaves was estimated with a method combining hemispherical photography and light measurements with quantum sensors made over the growing season. Long- and short-term light indices – average total seasonal daily integrated quantum flux density (Ts, mol m–2 d–1) and that of the 3 d preceding foliage sampling (T3d) – were calculated for each sampled leaf. In addition to total integrated quantum flux density, the part of Qi attributable to direct flux was also computed. Strong linear relationships between the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport per area (Jamax), estimated from in situ measurements of effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PS II), and Qi averaged over the season and over the preceding 3 d were found for all studied species. However, the major determinant of Jamax, the product of electron transport capacity per leaf dry mass (Jmmax) and leaf dry mass per area (MA), was MA rather than Jmmax, which was relatively constant along the light gradient. There was evidence that Jamax is more tightly related to Ts, which characterizes the light climate during foliar development, than to short-term integrated light, possibly because there is little flexibility in adjustments in MA after the completion of foliar growth. Leaf chlorophyll concentrations and the investment of leaf nitrogen in chlorophyll (Chl/N) were negatively related to Qi– an investment pattern which improves light harvesting in low light. Xanthophyll cycle pool size (VAZ, violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin) either expressed per unit chlorophyll (VAZ/Chl) or as a fraction of total carotenoids (VAZ/Car) increased with increasing Qi in all species. However, contrary to Jamax, it tended to correlate more strongly with short-term than with long-term average integrated light. There were few interspecific differences in Jamax, Chl/N, VAZ/Chl and VAZ/Car when the variability in light level incident to the leaves was accounted for, indicating that the foliage of both shade-intolerant and -tolerant temperate tree species possesses considerable phenotypic flexibility. Collectively these results support the view that rapid adjustment of the xanthophyll cycle pool size provides an important means for acclimation to light fluctuations in a time scale of days, during which the potential for photosynthetic quenching of excitation energy is not likely to change appreciably.},

The leaves of sub-canopy species T. cordata were on average exposed to lower irradiances, and they were also more horizontal with greater blade inclination angles (ϕB, defined as the angle between the leaf fall-line and the horizon; ϕB was positive for the leaves inclined upwards, and negative for the leaves inclined downwards) than those in P. tremula. Seasonal average daily integrated quantum flux density (Qint, mol m–2 day–1) and ϕB were not related in T. cordata, and only a weak negative effect of Qint on ϕB was detected in P. tremula. Nevertheless, when both species were pooled, there was a strong negative relationship between Qint and ϕB, implying that the leaves became progressively vertical with increasing height in the canopy. Interspecific differences in foliage inclination were mainly related to petiole morphology, in particular to petiole length, rather than to contrasting biomass investment patterns between assimilative and support tissues within the leaf. It was suggested that more horizontal leaves, resulting from the species-specific structure of petioles, partly explain the superior performance of shade-tolerant T. cordata in the understory and the sub-canopy.},

  abstract = {Intercellular CO2 mole fractions (Ci) are lower in the upper canopy relative to the lower canopy leaves. This canopy gradient in Ci has been associated with enhanced rates of carbon assimilation at high light, and concomitant greater draw-downs in Ci. However, increases in irradiance in the canopy are generally also associated with decreases in leaf water availability. Thus, stress effects on photosynthesis rates (A) and stomatal conductance (G), may provide a further explanation for the observed Ci gradients. To test the hypotheses of the sources of canopy variation in Ci, and quantitatively assess the influence of within-canopy differences in stomatal regulation on A, the seasonal and diurnal variation in G was studied in relation to seasonal average daily integrated quantum flux density (Qint) in tall shade-intolerant Populus tremula L. trees. Daily time-courses of A were simulated using the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. (Planta 149, 78–90, 1980). Stable carbon isotope composition of a leaf carbon fraction with rapid turnover rate was used to estimate canopy gradient in Ci during the simulations. Daily maximum G (Gmax) consistently increased with increasing Qint. However, canopy differences in Gmax decreased as soil water availability became limiting during the season. In water-stressed leaves, there were strong mid-day decreases in G that were poorly associated with vapour pressure deficits between the leaf and atmosphere, and the magnitude of the mid-day decreases in G occasionally interacted with long-term leaf light environment. Simulations indicated that the percentage of carbon lost due to mid-day stomatal closure was of the order of 5–10\%, and seasonal water stress increased this percentage up to 20\%. The percentage of carbon lost due to stomatal closure increased with increasing Qint. Canopy differences in light environment resulted in a gradient of daily average Ci of approximately 20 µmol mol−1. The canopy variation in seasonal and diurnal reductions in G led to a Ci gradient of approximately 100 µmol mol−1, and the actual canopy Ci gradient was of the same magnitude according to leaf carbon isotope composition. This study demonstrates that stress effects influence Ci more strongly than within-canopy light gradients, and also that leaves acclimated to different irradiance and water stress conditions may regulate water use largely independent of foliar photosynthetic potentials.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the interaction of growth irradiance (Qint) with leaf capacity for and kinetics of adjustment of the pool size of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (sum of violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin; VAZ) and photosynthetic electron transport rate (Jmax) after changes in leaf light environment. Individual leaves of lower-canopy/lower photosynthetic capacity species Tilia cordata Mill. and upper canopy/higher photosynthetic capacity species Populus tremula L. were either illuminated by additional light of 500–800 µmol m−2 s−1 for 12 h photoperiod or enclosed in shade bags. The extra irradiance increased the total amount of light intercepted by two-fold for the upper and 10–15-fold for the lower canopy leaves, whereas the shade bags transmitted 45\% of incident irradiance. In control leaves, VAZ/area, VAZ/Chl and Jmax were positively associated with leaf growth irradiance (Qint). After 11 d extra illumination, VAZ/Chl increased in all cases due to a strong reduction in foliar chlorophyll, but VAZ/area increased in the upper canopy leaves of both species, and remained constant or decreased in the lower canopy leaves of T. cordata. The slope for VAZ/area changes with cumulative extra irradiance was positively associated with Qint only in T. cordata, but not in P. tremula. Nevertheless, all leaves of P. tremula increased VAZ/area more than the most responsive leaves of T. cordata. Shading reduced VAZ content only in P. tremula, but not in T. cordata, again demonstrating that P. tremula is a more responsive species. Compatible with the hypothesis of the role of VAZ in photoprotection, the rates of photosynthetic electron transport declined less in P. tremula than in T. cordata after the extra irradiance treatment. However, foliar chlorophyll contents of the exposed leaves declined significantly more in the upper canopy of P. tremula, which is not consistent with the suggestion that the leaves with the highest VAZ content are more resistant to photoinhibition. This study demonstrates that previous leaf light environment may significantly affect the adaptation capacity of foliage to altered light environment, and also that species differences in photosynthetic capacity and acclimation potentials importantly alter this interaction.},

  abstract = {1 Successional replacement of intolerant species by shade tolerators along gap-understorey gradients is commonly associated with increasingly higher low-light carbon acquisition capacities of more tolerant species. This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny. 2 Light vs. MA relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower MA than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to MA increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR. 3 The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species’ successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological characteristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny.},

So far, quantitative relationships of E-S with irradiance are missing, and interspecific variation in E-S plasticity and potential effects on canopy level emissions have not been characterized. E-S, foliage structural, chemical, and photosynthetic characteristics were studied relative to integrated within-canopy daily quantum flux density (Q(int)) in temperate deciduous tree species Quercus robur, Populus tremula, Salix alba, and Salix caprea, and canopy isoprene emissions were calculated considering observed variation in E-S and under different simplifying assumptions. Strong positive curvilinear relationships between nitrogen and dry mass per unit area, photosynthetic potentials and E-S per area with Q(int) were observed. Structural, chemical, and photosynthetic traits varied 1.5-fold to 4-fold and E-S per area 3-fold to 27-fold within the canopy. E-S variation reflected accumulation of mesophyll cell layers and greater emission capacity of average cells. Species with largest structural and photosynthetic plasticity had greatest plasticity in E-S. Relative to the simulation considering within-canopy variation in E-S, the bias from assuming a constant E-S varied between -8\% and +68\%, and it scaled positively with E-S plasticity. The bias of big-leaf simulations varied between -22\% and -35\%, and it scaled negatively with E-S plasticity. A generalized canopy response function of E-S developed for all species resulted in the lowest bias between -11\% and 6\% and can be recommended for practical applications. The results highlight huge within-canopy and interspecific variation in E-S and demonstrate that ignoring these variations strongly biases canopy emission predictions.},

  abstract = {Within-canopy variation in leaf structural and photosynthetic characteristics is a major means by which whole canopy photosynthesis is maximized at given total canopy nitrogen. As key acclimatory modifications, leaf nitrogen content (NA) and photosynthetic capacity (AA) per unit area increase with increasing light availability in the canopy and these increases are associated with increases in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA) and/or nitrogen content per dry mass and/or allocation. However, leaf functional characteristics change with increasing leaf age during leaf development and aging, but the importance of these alterations for within-canopy trait gradients is unknown. I conducted a meta-analysis based on 71 canopies that were sampled at different time periods or, in evergreens, included measurements for different-aged leaves to understand how within-canopy variations in leaf traits (trait plasticity) depend on leaf age. The analysis demonstrated that in evergreen woody species, MA and NA plasticity decreased with increasing leaf age, but the change in AA plasticity was less suggesting a certain re-acclimation of AA to altered light. In deciduous woody species, MA and NA gradients in flush-type species increased during leaf development and were almost invariable through the rest of the season, while in continuously leaf-forming species, the trait gradients increased constantly with increasing leaf age. In forbs, NA plasticity increased, while in grasses, NA plasticity decreased with increasing leaf age, reflecting life form differences in age-dependent changes in light availability and in nitrogen resorption for growth of generative organs. Although more work is needed to improve the coverage of age-dependent plasticity changes in some plant life forms, I argue that the age-dependent variation in trait plasticity uncovered in this study is large enough to warrant incorporation in simulations of canopy photosynthesis through the growing period.},

  abstract = {1 A trade-off between the investments in functional and support structures is a major determinant of leaf physiological activities. A variety of leaf shapes and venation densities occur in coexisting vegetation, but the costs and benefits of various leaf shapes and venation architectures are poorly understood. As the lever arms (location of leaf mass centre) become effectively longer as the maximum of lamina mass distribution shifts farther from the lamina base, we hypothesized that the fraction of lamina biomass in the mid-rib (FMR) is larger in leaves in which the centroid of lamina mass is located at, or greater than, half-leaf length (‘elliptic’ leaves) compared with leaves having the centroid of lamina mass located closer to the leaf base (‘ovate’ leaves). We further hypothesized that minor vein density (ρV) is larger in leaves with lower FMR, compensating for lower investments in central support. Finally, we predicted that ρV is lower in parallel/palmate-veined than in pinnate-veined leaves, due to a more uniform distribution of large veins in parallel/palmate-veined leaves. 2 F MR and ρV were studied in 44 herbs and woody seedlings with an overall variation in lamina fresh mass (MFL) of more than five orders of magnitude, and a sixfold variation in leaf longevity. Species were separated between pinnate-veined elliptic and ovate leaves, and parallel- or palmate-veined elliptic and ovate leaves. 3 Contrary to the hypothesis, support investment in the mid-rib was similar among leaf shapes, and scaled positively with leaf size and negatively with leaf longevity. However, FMR and ρV were negatively associated. Fractional biomass investment in the mid-rib scaled with lamina size (fresh and dry mass and area), but at a common lamina size FMR was larger in pinnate-veined elliptic than in parallel/palmate-veined elliptic leaves. In addition, ρV was larger in pinnate than in parallel/palmate-veined leaves, and the differences in lamina carbon content further suggested an overall greater investment of lamina biomass in the minor veins of pinnate-veined leaves. 4 These data demonstrate that the effect of leaf shape on biomass investments in central support is less significant than predicted by biomechanical models, partly because of the trade-off between the biomass investments in central support and minor veins, which compensate for differences in lamina shape. These data collectively indicate that leaf size, longevity, shape and venation pattern can importantly modify the distribution of foliage biomass between support and functional tissues, and thus can alter foliage physiological activity and leaf functioning in environments with different resource availability.},

  abstract = {Plant canopies are characterized by extensive and interacting gradients in light, temperature, humidity and wind. As every leaf in the canopy is exposed to unique combinations of environmental variables and has distinctive suite of structural and physiological traits, modeling canopy photosynthesis is a challenging endeavor. Due to the highly non-linear response of photosynthesis to light, temperature and humidity, whole canopy photosynthesis cannot be derived from the average values of light and temperature, but complex models simulating both temporal and spatial variability in environmental drivers and photosynthetic potentials are needed to estimate canopy photosynthesis. Two fundamentally different classes of canopy models have been developed. Predictive integration algorithms that describe the actual spatial distribution of foliage elements and photosynthetic capacity have the objective to simulate whole-stand carbon uptake and other canopy processes as closely as possible. Recent advances in these models have led to complex three-dimensional (3D) models that are capable of simulating radiation interception in discontinuous canopies considering complex radiative transfer phenomena such as penumbra and light scattering. A large number of parameters needed is the disadvantage of these explicit integration algorithms. Alternatively, optimization models predict total canopy leaf area and foliage photosynthetic potentials from the assumption of maximization of canopy photosynthesis by the optimal use of available nitrogen or foliage biomass. Significantly smaller number of parameters is needed for these models as the spatial distributions of foliage and photosynthetic characteristics are determined by assumptions about optimality. However, the simple optimization models considering only light as the key environmental factor and assuming that plant canopy consists of identical individual non-competing plants result in a significant bias between simulated and measured photosynthesis profiles within the canopy, limiting the use of such models in practical scaling applications. Recently developed models considering competition between different individuals have yielded better correspondence between the data and predictions, suggesting that optimization models have a large potential for predictive purposes. More information of the functioning of plant canopies, in particular of the response of plants to multiple environmental stresses in the canopies as well as competitive interactions is still needed to define “right” optimization functions and to correctly simulate photosynthetic productivity in highly heterogeneous canopy environment.},

  abstract = {Plant canopies are characterized by dramatic gradients of light between canopy top and bottom, and interactions between light, temperature and water vapour deficits. This review summarizes current knowledge of potentials and limitations of acclimation of foliage photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and light-harvesting efficiency to complex environmental gradients within the canopies. Acclimation of Amax to high light availability involves accumulation of rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins per unit leaf area as the result of increases in leaf thickness in broad-leaved species and volume : total area ratio and mesophyll thickness in species with complex geometry of leaf cross-section. Enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency in low light occurs through increased chlorophyll production per unit dry mass, greater leaf area per unit dry mass investment in leaves and shoot architectural modifications that improve leaf exposure and reduce within-shoot shading. All these acclimation responses vary among species, resulting in species-specific use efficiencies of low and high light. In fast-growing canopies and in evergreen species, where foliage developed and acclimated to a certain light environment becomes shaded by newly developing foliage, leaf senescence, age-dependent changes in cell wall characteristics and limited foliage re-acclimation capacity can constrain adjustment of older leaves to modified light availabilities. The review further demonstrates that leaves in different canopy positions respond differently to dynamic fluctuations in light availability and to multiple environmental stresses. Foliage acclimated to high irradiance respond more plastically to rapid changes in leaf light environment, and is more resistant to co-occurring heat and water stress. However, in higher light, co-occurring stresses can more strongly curb the efficiency of foliage photosynthetic machinery through reductions in internal diffusion conductance to CO2. This review demonstrates strong foliage potential for acclimation to within-canopy environmental gradients, but also highlights complex constraints on acclimation and foliage functioning resulting from light × foliage age interactions, multiple environmental stresses, dynamic light fluctuations and species-specific leaf and shoot structural constraints.},

  abstract = {Abstract: There is a strong natural light gradient from the top to the bottom in plant canopies and along gap-understorey continua. Leaf structure and photosynthetic capacities change close to proportionally along these gradients, leading to maximisation of whole canopy photosynthesis. However, other environmental factors also vary within the light gradients in a correlative manner. Specifically, the leaves exposed to higher irradiance suffer from more severe heat, water, and photoinhibition stresses. Research in tree canopies and across gap-understorey gradients demonstrates that plants have a large potential to acclimate to interacting environmental limitations. The optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport increases with increasing growth irradiance in the canopy, improving the resistance of photosynthetic apparatus to heat stress. Stomatal constraints on photosynthesis are also larger at higher irradiance because the leaves at greater evaporative demands regulate water use more efficiently. Furthermore, upper canopy leaves are more rigid and have lower leaf osmotic potentials to improve water extraction from drying soil. The current review highlights that such an array of complex interactions significantly modifies the potential and realized whole canopy photosynthetic productivity, but also that the interactive effects cannot be simply predicted as composites of additive partial environmental stresses. We hypothesize that plant photosynthetic capacities deviate from the theoretical optimum values because of the interacting stresses in plant canopies and evolutionary trade-offs between leaf- and canopy-level plastic adjustments in light capture and use.},

  abstract = {Forest trees are exposed to a myriad of single and combined stresses with varying strength and duration throughout their lifetime, and many of the simultaneous and successive stress factors strongly interact. While much progress has been achieved in understanding the effects of single stresses on tree performance, multiple interacting stress effects cannot be adequately assessed from combination of single factor analyses. In particular, global change brings about novel combinations of severity and timing of different stresses, the effects of which on tree performance are currently hard to predict. Furthermore, the combinations of stresses commonly sustained by trees change during tree ontogeny. In addition, tree photosynthesis and growth rates decline with increasing tree age and size, while support biomass in roots, stem and branches accumulates and the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates increase, collectively resulting in an enhancement of non-structural carbon pools. In this review, tree physiological responses to key environmental stress factors and their combinations are analyzed from seedlings to mature trees. The key conclusions of this analysis are that combined stresses can influence survival of large trees even more than chronic exposure to a single predictable stress such as drought. In addition, tree tolerance to many environmental stresses increases throughout the ontogeny as the result of accumulation of non-structural carbon pools, implying major change in sensing, response and acclimation to single and multiple stresses in trees of different size and age.},

  abstract = {Responses of foliar light-saturated net assimilation rate (Amax), capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) and mitochondrial respiration rate (Rd) to long-term canopy light and temperature environment were investigated in a temperate deciduous canopy composed of Populus tremula L. in the upper (17–28 m) and of Tilia cordata Mill. in the lower canopy layer (4–17 m). Climatic measurements indicated that seasonal average daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) was 5·5 °C (range 0·7–10·5 °C) higher in the top than in the bottom of the canopy, and strong positive correlations were observed between Tmax and seasonal average integrated quantum flux density (Qint), as well as between seasonal average daily mean temperature and Qint. Because of changes in leaf dry mass and nitrogen per unit area, Amax, Jmax, and Rd scaled positively with Qint in both species at a common leaf temperature (T). According to Jmax versus T response curves and dark chlorophyll fluorescence transients, photosynthetic electron transport was less heat resistant in P. tremula with optimum temperature of Jmax, Topt, of 33·5 ± 0·6 °C than in T. cordata with Topt of 40·7 ± 0·6 °C. This difference was suggested to manifest evolutionary adaptation of photosynthetic electron transport to cooler environments in P. tremula, the range of which extends farther north than that in T. cordata. Possibly because of acclimation to long-term canopy temperature environment, Topt was positively related to Qint in P. tremula, foliage of which was also exposed to higher irradiances and temperatures, but not in T. cordata, in the canopy of which quantum flux densities and temperatures were lower, and gradients in the environmental factors less pronounced. Parallel to changes in Topt, the activation energy for photosynthetic electron transport decreased with increasing Qint in P. tremula, indicating that Jmax of leaves acclimated to colder environment was more responsive to T in lower temperatures than that of high T acclimated leaves. Similar alterations in the activation energy for mitochondrial respiration rate were also observed, indicating that acclimation to temperature of mitochondrial and chloroplastic electron transport proceeds in a co-ordinated manner, and possibly involves long-term changes in membrane fluidity properties. We conclude that, because of correlations between temperature and light, the shapes of Jmax versus T, and Rd versus T response curves vary within tree canopies, and this needs to be taken account in modelling whole canopy photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Lack of information on ecological characteristics of species across different continents hinders development of general world-scale quantitative vegetation dynamic models. We constructed common scales of shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerance for 806 North American, European/West Asian, and East Asian temperate shrubs and trees representing about 40\% of the extant natural Northern Hemisphere species pool. These scales were used to test the hypotheses that shade tolerance is negatively related to drought and waterlogging tolerances, and that these correlations vary among continents and plant functional types. We observed significant negative correlations among shade and drought tolerance rankings for all data pooled, and separately for every continent and plant functional type, except for evergreen angiosperms. Another significant trade-off was found for drought and waterlogging tolerance for all continents, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, but not for gymnosperms. For all data pooled, for Europe and East Asia, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, shade tolerance was also negatively associated with waterlogging tolerance. Quantile regressions revealed that the negative relationship between shade and drought tolerance was significant for species growing in deep to moderate shade and that the negative relationship between shade and waterlogging tolerance was significant for species growing in moderate shade to high light, explaining why all relationships between different tolerances were negative according to general regression analyses. Phylogenetic signal in the tolerance to any one of the three environmental factors studied was significant but low, with only 21–24\% of cladogram nodes exhibiting significant conservatism. The inverse relationships between different tolerances were significant in phylogenetically independent analyses both for the overall pool of species and for two multispecies genera (Pinus and Quercus) for which reliable molecular phylogenies were available. Only 2.6–10.3\% of the species were relatively tolerant to two environmental stresses simultaneously (tolerance value ≥3), and only three species were tolerant to all three stresses, supporting the existence of functional trade-offs in adjusting to multiple environmental limitations. These trade-offs represent a constraint for niche differentiation, reducing the diversity of plant responses to the many combinations of irradiance and water supply that are found in natural ecosystems.},

We distinguished between the age-dependent changes in net assimilation rates due to modifications in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), foliar nitrogen content per unit dry mass (NM), and fractional partitioning of foliar nitrogen in the proteins of photosynthetic electron transport (FB), Rubisco (FR) and in light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (Vcmax;A ∝ MANMFR; Jmax;A ∝ MANMFB). In both species, increases in Jmax;A and Vcmax;A during leaf development were primarily determined by nitrogen allocation to growing leaves, increases in leaf nitrogen partitioning in photosynthetic machinery, and increases in MA. Canopy differences in the rate of development of leaf photosynthetic capacity were mainly controlled by the rate of change in MA. There was only small within-canopy variation in the initial rate of biomass accumulation per unit Qint (slope of MA versus leaf age relationship per unit Qint), suggesting that canopy differences in the rate of development of Jmax;A and Vcmax;A are directly proportional to Qint. Nevertheless, MA, nitrogen, Jmax;A and Vcmax;A of mature leaves were not proportional to Qint because of a finite MA in leaves immediately after bud-burst (light-independent component of MA). MA, leaf chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll : N ratio of mature leaves were best correlated with the integrated average quantum flux density during leaf development, suggesting that foliar photosynthetic apparatus, once developed, is not affected by day-to-day fluctuations in Qint. However, for the upper canopy leaves of P. tremula and for the entire canopy of T. cordata, there was a continuous decline in N contents per unit dry mass in mature non-senescent leaves on the order of 15–20\% for a change of leaf age from 40 to 120 d, possibly manifesting nitrogen reallocation to bud formation. The decline in N contents led to similar decreases in leaf photosynthetic capacity and foliar chlorophyll contents. These data demonstrate that light-dependent variation in the rate of developmental changes in MA determines canopy differences in photosynthetic capacity, whereas foliar photosynthetic apparatus is essentially constant in fully developed leaves.},

  abstract = {Tropical canopies are complex, with multiple canopy layers and pronounced gap dynamics contributing to their high species diversity and productivity. An important reason for this complexity is the large variation in shade tolerance among different tree species. At present, we lack a clear understanding of which plant traits control this variation, e.g., regarding the relative contributions of whole-plant versus leaf traits or structural versus physiological traits. We investigated a broad range of traits in six tropical montane rainforest tree species with different degrees of shade tolerance, grown under three different radiation regimes (under the open sky or beneath sparse or dense canopies). The two distinct shade-tolerant species had higher fractional biomass in leaves and branches while shade-intolerant species invested more into stems, and these differences were greater under low radiation. Leaf respiration and photosynthetic light compensation point did not vary with species shade tolerance, regardless of radiation regime. Leaf temperatures in open plots were markedly higher in shade-tolerant species due to their low transpiration rates and large leaf sizes. Our results suggest that interspecific variation in shade tolerance of tropical montane trees is controlled by species differences in whole-plant biomass allocation strategy rather than by difference in physiological leaf traits determining leaf carbon balance at low radiation.},

Leaves of P. macroloba from three heights in the forest canopy were compared with leaves of seedlings grown in controlled environment chambers under four different irradiance levels. Changes in leaf characteristics along the canopy gradient paralleled changes resulting from the light gradient under controlled conditions. The effect of light or canopy position on light-saturated photosynthesis was small, with maximum photosynthesis increasing from 5 to 6.5 μmol m−-2 s−-1 from understory to canopy. Both chamber grown and field leaves showed large adjustments in photosynthetic efficiency at low light via reductions in dark respiration rates and increases in apparent quantum yields. Light saturation of all leaves occurred at or below 500 μmol m−-2 s−-1. Leaf thickness, specific leaf weight, and stomatal density increased to a greater extent than saturated photosynthesis with higher irradiance during growth or height in the canopy. As a result, there was a poor correspondence between leaf thickness and light-saturated photosynthesis on an area basis. It is concluded that Pentaclethra macroloba possesses the characteristics of a typical shade-tolerant species.},

Despite being an even-aged stand growing in a relatively uniform environment with respect to nutrient and water availability, the stand exhibited considerable structural complexity. Diameter at 1.3 m ranged between 3 cm and 21 cm, trees average 12 m height and stand leaf area index was \textasciitilde 6 m2 m–2 leading to strong gradients in light availability. We were interested in understanding the processes governing canopy production in trees of contrasting dominance classes. Vertical gradients in photosynthesis and foliar respiration were studied within the canopies of dominant and suppressed trees during 2006 and 2007. Amax varied from \textasciitilde 18 μmol m–2 s–1 in the upper canopy to 3 μmol m–2 s–1 at lower canopy positions. On average, Amax were higher in the dominant trees than in the suppressed trees. However, at any given height, Amax were similar in suppressed and dominant trees and were strongly related to leaf nitrogen content. Dark respiration varied from \textasciitilde 1.4 μmol m–2 s–1 in the upper canopy to 0.2 μmol m–2 s–1 in the lower canopy positions. In contrast to the patterns for Amax, dark respiration rates in the suppressed trees were higher than dominant trees at similar canopy positions. Respiration rates were also strongly related to [N]area and to Amax.},

  abstract = {Increasing air temperature is expected to extend growing season length in temperate, broadleaf forests, leading to potential increases in evapotranspiration and net carbon uptake. However, other key processes affecting water and carbon cycles are also highly temperature-dependent. Warmer temperatures may result in higher ecosystem carbon loss through respiration and higher potential evapotranspiration through increased atmospheric demand for water. Thus, the net effects of a warming planet are uncertain and highly dependent on local climate and vegetation. We analyzed five years of data from the Coweeta eddy covariance tower in the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, USA, a highly productive region that has historically been underrepresented in flux observation networks. We examined how leaf phenology and climate affect water and carbon cycling in a mature forest in one of the wettest biomes in North America. Warm temperatures in early 2012 caused leaf-out to occur two weeks earlier than in cooler years and led to higher seasonal carbon uptake. However, these warmer temperatures also drove higher winter ecosystem respiration, offsetting much of the springtime carbon gain. Interannual variability in net carbon uptake was high (147 to 364 g C m−2 y−1), but unrelated to growing season length. Instead, years with warmer growing seasons had 10\% higher respiration and sequestered ∼40\% less carbon than cooler years. In contrast, annual evapotranspiration was relatively consistent among years (coefficient of variation = 4\%) despite large differences in precipitation (17\%, range = 800 mm). Transpiration by the evergreen understory likely helped to compensate for phenologically-driven differences in canopy transpiration. The increasing frequency of high summer temperatures is expected to have a greater effect on respiration than growing season length, reducing forest carbon storage.},

  abstract = {• Premise of the study: Leaves at the tops of most trees are smaller, thicker, and in many other ways different from leaves on the lowermost branches. This height-related variation in leaf structure has been explained as acclimation to differing light environments and, alternatively, as a consequence of hydrostatic, gravitational constraints on turgor pressure that reduce leaf expansion. • Methods: To separate hydrostatic effects from those of light availability, we used anatomical analysis of height-paired samples from the inner and outer tree crowns of tall redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens). • Key results: Height above the ground correlates much more strongly with leaf anatomy than does light availability. Leaf length, width, and mesophyll porosity all decrease linearly with height and help explain increases in leaf-mass-to-area ratio and decreases in both photosynthetic capacity and internal gas-phase conductance with increasing height. Two functional traits—leaf thickness and transfusion tissue—also increase with height and may improve water-stress tolerance. Transfusion tissue area increases enough that whole-leaf vascular volume does not change significantly with height in most trees. Transfusion tracheids become deformed with height, suggesting they may collapse under water stress and act as a hydraulic buffer that improves leaf water status and reduces the likelihood of xylem dysfunction. • Conclusions: That such variation in leaf structure may be caused more by gravity than by light calls into question use of the terms “sun” and “shade” to describe leaves at the tops and bottoms of tall tree crowns.},

  abstract = {Understanding variation in leaf functional traits—including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus—is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (               LMA               ) within species but are roughly independent of               LMA               across the global flora.               LMA               is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (               LL               ). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most               LMA               variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most               LMA               variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (               i               ) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with               LMA               across species assemblages with low               LL               variance but should increase weakly with               LMA               across species assemblages with high               LL               variance and that (               ii               ) controlling for               LL               variation should increase the strength of the above               LMA               relationships. We present analyses of intra- and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to               LMA               variation in a given assemblage.},

  abstract = {High-temperature tolerance in plants is important in a warming world, with extreme heat waves predicted to increase in frequency and duration, potentially leading to lethal heating of leaves. Global patterns of high-temperature tolerance are documented in animals, but generally not in plants, limiting our ability to assess risks associated with climate warming. To assess whether there are global patterns in high-temperature tolerance of leaf metabolism, we quantified Tcrit (high temperature where minimal chlorophyll a fluorescence rises rapidly and thus photosystem II is disrupted) and Tmax (temperature where leaf respiration in darkness is maximal, beyond which respiratory function rapidly declines) in upper canopy leaves of 218 plant species spanning seven biomes. Mean site-based Tcrit values ranged from 41.5 °C in the Alaskan arctic to 50.8 °C in lowland tropical rainforests of Peruvian Amazon. For Tmax, the equivalent values were 51.0 and 60.6 °C in the Arctic and Amazon, respectively. Tcrit and Tmax followed similar biogeographic patterns, increasing linearly (˜8 °C) from polar to equatorial regions. Such increases in high-temperature tolerance are much less than expected based on the 20 °C span in high-temperature extremes across the globe. Moreover, with only modest high-temperature tolerance despite high summer temperature extremes, species in mid-latitude ( 20–50°) regions have the narrowest thermal safety margins in upper canopy leaves; these regions are at the greatest risk of damage due to extreme heat-wave events, especially under conditions when leaf temperatures are further elevated by a lack of transpirational cooling. Using predicted heat-wave events for 2050 and accounting for possible thermal acclimation of Tcrit and Tmax, we also found that these safety margins could shrink in a warmer world, as rising temperatures are likely to exceed thermal tolerance limits. Thus, increasing numbers of species in many biomes may be at risk as heat-wave events become more severe with climate change.},

  abstract = {The purpose of our study was to examine change in leaf structure (anatomy and morphology) through different phases of tree size and crown position within a Sri Lankan rain forest. We selected four late-successional canopy species that represented dominant genera (Shorea, Mesua) within an Asian tropical rain forest. All are considered shade-tolerant and capable of growing to maturity beneath closed-canopy late-successional forests. Species within each genus were either restricted to seepages and bottom slopes (valley species) or to upper slopes and ridges (ridge species). The size classes represented (i) seedlings, (ii) saplings, (iii) poles growing beneath closed-canopy conditions, and (iv) trees of the rain forest canopy. Between size classes, leaves were thicker and with higher stomatal densities for canopy trees than for seedling, sapling, and pole size classes. Plasticities for measures of leaf structure were greater for ridge species than valley species; except for cuticle thickness, which showed the opposite trend (valley {$>$} ridge). Area, length, and width of leaves attained maxima for the sapling size class for all species. Drip-tip lengths were greatest for seedlings of all species, and least for canopy trees. Trends in leaf structure and morphology dimensions across size classes for late-successional canopy tree species are the same as those trends reported between rain forest species of different habitat strata (e.g., understory shrubs versus upper canopy trees). Our results suggest leaf dimensions could provide robust measures of environment, irrespective of species, or size class of tree.},

  abstract = {We studied the interplay of atmospheric and canopy structure factors driving the canopy light environment (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density, PPFD) in primary moist tropical forest in the Tapajós National Forest, Brazil. We quantified the temporal and spatial length scales that characterize intact rain forest inhomogeneities, asking: Are seasonal changes in the canopy radiation balance evident at these scales? We sought to describe the components of intensity, duration and spatial variation of within-canopy PPFD in light of these inhomogeneities. Do fluctuating atmospheric conditions, especially the presence of clouds and precipitation, affect the radiative inputs at both the canopy top and the forest floor? We examined the characteristic scales of heterogeneity in the vertical and the horizontal using a two-part approach. For radiation we combined long-term continuous high-frequency measurements of down- and up-welling short-wave and visible wavebands above the canopy with similarly frequent observations from a dense sensor network at forest floor. Vertical variations in canopy structure, obtained with a ground-based LIDAR, similarly combined intensive observations at the sensor network with occasional large-scale transects along the forest floor. Close similarities in both radiation and canopy structure at both scales support the representativeness of local observations of the wider area. A composite broadband measure similar to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (denoted cbNDVI) was constructed from above-canopy observations to compare with reports of remotely sensed canopy reflectivity at this site. We estimated the canopy Leaf Area Index (LAI) by combining observations of the variation in understory transmittance by solar elevation with a commonly-used algorithm. We obtained the conventional whole-canopy extinction coefficient, by applying the Beer-Lambert law. Over the course of a year this forest receives 11,795\,mol m−2, only 62\% of potential clear-day PPFD – atmospheric transmissivity is reduced by clouds, precipitation, smoke and haze. Very little PAR (≈ 2\%) is reflected from the canopy and only 5.7\% penetrates to 1\,m above the forest floor - overall 92\% of PAR is absorbed by the canopy. All radiation balance components closely tracked the dynamics of incoming light, showing little seasonal variation. Understory light observations across the 7.5–28.5\,m spanning the understory array sensors showed essentially constant correlation between sensor pairs over time. There was a high degree of local persistence in the understory spatial pattern that varied slowly and directionally with the changing geometry of the sun and canopy structure. Over larger distances (to 1000\,m), the patterns of spatial autocorrelation of understory PPFD and outer canopy structure were remarkably similar in shape, both declining rapidly to a more-or-less constant level around 15–20\,m, a scale consistent with the dimensions of outer canopy crowns. The vertical pattern of transmission and absorption was estimated by combining understory transmittance with the distribution of canopy surface area obtained from the ground-based LIDAR system. It showed the maximum absorption relatively low in the canopy (8–19\,m above ground). Although rather tall (canopy height is at 41.5\,m), the extremely elaborate outer surface of the forest suggests the layers highest above ground are of little consequence to the PAR absorption budget. The cbNDVI measure exhibited seasonal variation consistent with other reports (somewhat higher in the wet season) but in contrast to a recent argument that the forest ‘greens up’ during the early dry season. However, except for the variations caused by the angle and intensity of incoming light modulated by atmospheric effects, there was little seasonality in the forest light environment at km67, including: canopy reflectances in several wavebands, all PPFD radiation budget components, the estimated LAI and mid-day PAR extinction coefficient and the length scales of understory PPFD. Canopy transmission was somewhat greater (6.4\%) under diffuse skies compared to the least diffuse conditions (6.0\%), and slightly more PPFD was absorbed under diffuse (92.7\%) versus the least diffuse conditions (92.3\%), but was not a significant contribution to the budget. The large diurnal variations in the extinction coefficient seriously affects its utility as a descriptor of canopy radiative properties. We propose an alternative approach for transmitted light: the canopy behaves as: 1.) a constant fraction filter under diffuse conditions, combined with 2.) a variable filter depending on solar elevation for sunfleck conditions. These regimes may be described with simple parameters each having mechanistic relations to canopy structure. In summary, we demonstrate that obtaining the radiation signal at forest floor at high data rate for long periods exploits seasonal sun angle changes to probe canopy structure. Combined with occasional long transect information, temporal and vertical sampling spatially allow improved definition of characteristic scales to describe both the understory light environment and canopy structure.},

Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were calculated by vertical level, time, and species; the time-integrated duration of leaf display (leaf area extent, LAE) was estimated by species and vertical level. In this stand LAI rises rapidly in the spring, declines slightly during the growing season, and then rapidly in the fall. In the intensively studied year, total LAI peaked at 7.1 m2m–2, LAE was 1259 m2m–2day, and the length of the canopy season (time from half-maximum LAI at leaf-out to the half-maximum at decline) was 191 days. The maximum growing season LAI, the date of leaf emergence, and the LAE differed among years, ranging 0.61 m2m–2, 14 days, and 261 m2m–2day, respectively. However, the timing of leaf fall was more consistent, ranging only 6 days. Each species differs in its height distribution, density, and timing of foliar display. In the canopy, leaf number, area, and duration are the bases of species importance; these differ substantially by species from typical importance values derived from stem-based attributes (density, basal area, biomass).

We derive a forest drought-stress index (FDSI) for the southwestern United States using a comprehensive tree-ring data set representing AD 1000–2007. The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by the warm-season vapour-pressure deficit (largely controlled by temperature) and cold-season precipitation, together explaining 82\% of the FDSI variability. Correspondence between the FDSI and measures of forest productivity, mortality, bark-beetle outbreak and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic forest-vigour indicator. If the vapour-pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models, the mean forest drought-stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years. Collectively, the results foreshadow twenty-first-century changes in forest structures and compositions, with transition of forests in the southwestern United States, and perhaps water-limited forests globally, towards distributions unfamiliar to modern civilization.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests are hyper-diverse and perform critical functions that regulate global climate, yet they are also threatened by rising temperatures. Canopy temperatures depart considerably from air temperatures, sometimes by as much as air temperatures are projected to increase by the end of this century; however, canopy temperatures are rarely measured or considered in climate change analyses. Our results from near-continuous thermal imaging of a well-studied tropical forest show that canopy temperatures reached a maximum of 34°C, and exceeded maximum air temperatures by as much as 7°C. Comparing different canopy surfaces reveals that bark was the warmest, followed by a deciduous canopy, flowers, and coolest was an evergreen canopy. Differences among canopy surfaces were largest during afternoon hours, when the evergreen canopy cooled more rapidly than other canopy surfaces, presumably due to transpiration. Gross primary productivity (GPP), estimated from eddy covariance measurements, was more strongly associated with canopy temperatures than air temperatures or vapor pressure deficit. The rate of GPP increase with canopy temperatures slowed above 28–29°C, but GPP continued to increase until 31–32°C. Although future warming is projected to be greater in high-latitude regions, we show that tropical forest productivity is highly sensitive to small changes in temperature. Important biophysical and physiological characteristics captured by canopy temperatures allow more accurate predictions of GPP compared to commonly used air temperatures. Results suggest that as air temperatures continue to warm with climate change, canopy temperatures will increase at a 40\% higher rate, with uncertain but potentially large impacts on tropical forest productivity.},

  abstract = {Sun and shade environments place markedly different constraints on the photosynthetic performance of plants. Leaf-level photosynthetic responses to sun and shade have been extensively investigated, whereas there has been much less research on the functional role of crown architecture in these environments. This paper focuses on the role of architecture in maximizing light capture and photosynthesis in shaded understories and in minimizing exposure to excess radiation in open high light environments. Understanding these contrasting roles of architecture is facilitated by application of a three-dimensional structural–functional model, Y-plant. Surveys of understory plants reveal a diversity of architectures but a strong convergence at only modest light-capture efficiencies because of significant self-shading. Simulations with Psychotria species revealed that increasing internode lengths would increase light-capture efficiencies and whole plant carbon gain. However, the costs of the additional required biomechanical support was high, which, in terms of relative growth rates, would override the advantage provided by higher light-capture efficiencies. In high light environments, leaf angles and self-shading provide structural photoprotection, minimizing potential damage from photoinhbition. Simulations reveal that without these structural protections photoinhibition of photosynthesis is likely to be much greater with daily carbon gain significantly reduced.},

Acclimation to the prevailing light environment was evident in all species, with the canopy leaves having higher light saturated photosynthetic rates, dark respiration rates and stomatal conductances than the understory leaves. For A. peralatum, leaves in the gap were generally intermediate between those in the canopy and understory. There was no evidence for acclimation to the differences in temperature or leaf-air vapour pressure deficits between the canopy and understory leaves. Determinations of the daily courses of CO\textsubscript{2} uptake showed that although the daily photon flux density (PFD) in the understory was only 3\% of that at the canopy top, leaf carbon gain was nearly 10\% of that measured for the canopy leaf. In the understory, photosynthesis during sunflecks accounted for about one third of the daily carbon gain.

Andira legalis (Vell.) Toledo is a legume shrub widespread along the sandy plains of the Brazilian coast. It occurs both shaded, in forest habitats, or exposed to full sunlight, in the vegetation islands growing on sand deposits. Previous studies reported a high range of morpho-physiological variation for this species along a geographical gradient. This study compared leaf morphology and anatomy of A. legalis in two distinct but adjacent light environments: a dense forest (shaded) and a scrub of Palmae (exposed). We studied the amplitude of variation for these traits within a small (0.5 ha) geographical area. Leaf anatomy parameters were measured for five leaves collected from five plants in each habitat. The parameters measured were leaf and mesophyll thickness, thickness of the outer periclinal cell wall, thickness of the adaxial and abaxial epidermis and vascular bundle transversal section area, and also common epidermal cells, stomata and trichome density. Leaf morphology parameters were obtained from five leaves of each of 20 plants in each site. Dry and fresh weights were measured to obtain leaf specific mass and succulence. All anatomy and morphology parameters, except trichome density, were significantly higher for the sun-exposed plants. Less expected, however, was the marked qualitative difference between exposed and shaded plants: in the former the mesophyll had a unilateral symmetry (i.e., the whole mesophyll occupied by photosynthetic tissue), whereas in the latter there was a dorsiventral symmetry (i.e., partly palisade and partly spongy parenchyma). Such amplitude of variation shows that even within a small geographic area A. legalis has a broad ecological plasticity.},

Depending on the microsite, W. urens plants had smooth leaves with glandular trichomes or bristly leaves with both glandular trichomes and urticant trichomes (stinging hairs). Trichome density (number of urticant trichomes per unit leaf area) was higher in the dry season than in the wet season, and was significantly correlated with both temperature (r = 0.353, P {$<$} 0.05) and photosynthetic active radiation (r = 0.313, P {$<$} 0.05). Plants established in sun-exposed areas had trichome densities three times higher than those of plants established in shaded areas during the dry season, and 28 times higher during the wet season. At both exposed and shaded sites, trichome densities of the youngest leaves of young plants were higher than those of the youngest leaves of mature plants. In smooth and bristly leaves, transpiration rates decreased with increasing temperature during the day. However, smooth leaves had higher transpiration rates than bristly leaves at both exposed and shaded sites. In laboratory studies, trichome density was significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced when small sun-grown plants (0.20-0.30 m tall) were either shaded or irrigated. In larger plants, also, irrigation significantly (P {$<$} 0.01) reduced trichome density relative to that of unirrigated controls.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic heat tolerances (PHTs) have several potential applications including predicting which species will be most vulnerable to climate change. Given that plants exhibit unique thermoregulatory traits that influence leaf temperatures and decouple them from ambient air temperatures, we hypothesized that PHTs should be correlated with extreme leaf temperatures as opposed to air temperatures. We measured leaf thermoregulatory traits, maximum leaf temperatures (TMO) and two metrics of PHT (Tcrit and T50) quantified using the quantum yield of photosystem II for 19 plant species growing in Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (Coral Gables, FL, USA). Thermoregulatory traits measured at the Garden and microenvironmental variables were used to parameterize a leaf energy balance model that estimated maximum in situ leaf temperatures (TMIS) across the geographic distributions of 13 species. TMO and TMIS were positively correlated with T50 but were not correlated with Tcrit. The breadth of species' thermal safety margins (the difference between T50 and TMO) was negatively correlated with T50. Our results provide observational and theoretical support based on a first principles approach for the hypothesis that PHTs may be adaptations to extreme leaf temperature, but refute the assumption that species with higher PHTs are less susceptible to thermal damage. Our study also introduces a novel method for studying plant ecophysiology by incorporating biophysical and species distribution models, and highlights how the use of air temperature versus leaf temperature can lead to conflicting conclusions about species vulnerability to thermal damage.

  abstract = {Aim High heat tolerance is a potential way for plants to maintain performance under high temperatures that can be acted upon by environmental filters to influence community assembly. Plant heat tolerances are phenotypically plastic and thus common garden experiments are needed to test if species from hotter environments have consistently higher heat tolerance than species from colder environments. Past studies that have measured heat tolerance from species grown in common gardens have found conflicting relationships between species' climatic origins and their heat tolerance, possibly due to phylogenetic non-independence of study species. In this study, we test the hypothesis that phylogenetic structure can help to explain variation in heat tolerance in order to resolve the confliciting relationships between climate and plant heat tolerance. Location Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and the Gifford Arboretum, Miami, FL, USA. Taxon Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. Methods We tested for phylogenetic signal in the photosynthetic heat tolerance of 123 species of ferns, gymnosperms, magnoliids, monocots and eudicots by calculating Blomberg's K. Phylogenetic independent contrasts of heat tolerance and climatic distributions for {$>$}100 species were used to test the hypothesis that climate can predict variation in heat tolerance. Results Species' heat tolerances were not phylogenetically conserved according to Blomberg's K, but we found significant differences in the heat tolerance of ferns, gymnosperms, magnoliids, monocots and eudicots. When controlling for phylogenetic non-independence, we found a significant, but weak relationship between the mean maximum temperature of the warmest month of species' climatic distributions and their photosynthetic heat tolerance. Main conclusions We conclude that phylogeny and climate are weak predictors of photosynthetic heat tolerance. However, differences among the groups we studied suggest that the variation in heat tolerance may be better explained by differences in microenvironment, thermoregulatory traits and leaf temperatures.},

Understanding regional heatwave trends has critical implications for the biophysical and human systems they impact. Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by~the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.},

  abstract = {The thermal limit of ectotherms provides an estimate of vulnerability to climate change. It differs between contrasting microhabitats, consistent with thermal ecology predictions that a species’ temperature sensitivity matches the microclimate it experiences. However, observed thermal limits may differ between ectotherms from the same environment, challenging this theory. We resolved this apparent paradox by showing that ectotherm activity generates microclimatic deviations large enough to account for differences in thermal limits between species from the same microhabitat. We studied upper lethal temperature, effect of feeding mode on plant gas exchange, and temperature of attacked leaves in a community of six arthropod species feeding on apple leaves. Thermal limits differed by up to 8 °C among the species. Species that caused an increase in leaf transpiration (+182\%), thus cooling the leaf, had a lower thermal limit than those that decreased leaf transpiration (−75\%), causing the leaf to warm up. Therefore, cryptic microclimatic variations at the scale of a single leaf determine the thermal limit in this community of herbivores. We investigated the consequences of these changes in plant transpiration induced by plant–insect feedbacks for species vulnerability to thermal extremes. Warming tolerance was similar between species, at ±2 °C, providing little margin for resisting increasingly frequent and intense heat waves. The thermal safety margin (the difference between thermal limit and temperature) was greatly overestimated when air temperature or intact leaf temperature was erroneously used. We conclude that feedback processes define the vulnerability of species in the phyllosphere, and beyond, to thermal extremes.},

When grown in the same controlled environment, leaf succulents and woody evergreen, perennial or slow-growing species have inherently high LMA. Within most of the functional groups studied, high-LMA species show higher leaf tissue densities. However, differences between evergreen and deciduous species result from larger volumes per area (thickness). Response curves constructed from experiments under controlled conditions showed that LMA varied strongly with light, temperature and submergence, moderately with CO2 concentration and nutrient and water stress, and marginally under most other conditions. Functional groups differed in the plasticity of LMA to these gradients. The physiological regulation is still unclear, but the consequences of variation in LMA and the suite of traits interconnected with it are strong. This trait complex is an important factor determining the fitness of species in their environment and affects various ecosystem processes.},

The species tested represent a spectrum of regeneration patterns ranging from shade tolerant to light demanding. Overall, leaf optical properties of the four species were similar. Differences in absorptance were small, but statistically significant among the species and positions along the canopy gradient. Species absorptance differences corresponded somewhat to shade tolerance; two of the shade species showed higher absorptance in lower light environments, while the sun species showed the reverse pattern. Specific leaf mass (leaf weight per unit area) and chlorophyll content per unit leaf weight also changed along the canopy gradient. Specific leaf mass was positively correlated and chlorophyll per unit leaf weight was negatively correlated with increasing light environment. Consequently, the efficiency of absorption, as represented by the absorptance per unit leaf weight, increased as light level decreased, largely due to changes in specific leaf mass. In contrast, efficiency of absorption per unit leaf chlorophyll was relatively constant with light environment for the two species measured for chlorophyll.},

There were few differences in leaf characteristics of sun leaves between the climax and pioneer species. Absorptance values of cloud forest species were comparable with values reported for rain forest and more seasonal forest species.

  abstract = {Trees forage for light through optimal leaf display. Effective leaf display is determined by metamer traits (i.e., the internode, petiole, and corresponding leaf), and thus these traits strongly co-determine carbon gain and as a result competitive advantage in a light-limited environment. We examined 11 metamer traits of sun and shade trees of 38 coexisting moist forest tree species and determined the relative strengths of intra- and interspecific variation. Species-specific metamer traits were related to two variables that represent important life history variation; the regeneration light requirements and average leaf size of the species. Metamer traits varied strongly across species and, in contrast to our expectation, showed only modest changes in response to light. Intra- and interspecific responses to light were only congruent for a third of the traits evaluated. Four traits, amongst which leaf size, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf area ratio at the metamer level (LAR) showed even opposite intra- and interspecific responses to light. Strikingly, these are classic traits that are thought to be of paramount importance for plant performance but that have completely different consequences within and across species. Sun trees of a given species had small leaves to reduce the heat load, but light-demanding species had large leaves compared to shade-tolerants, probably to outcompete their neighbors. Shade trees of a given species had a high SLA and LAR to capture more light in a light-limited environment, whereas shade-tolerant species have well-protected leaves with a low SLA compared to light-demanding species, probably to deter herbivores and enhance leaf lifespan. There was a leaf-size-mediated trade-off between biomechanical and hydraulic safety, and the efficiency with which species can space their leaves and forage for light. Unexpectedly, metamer traits were more closely linked to leaf size than to regeneration light requirements, probably because leaf-size-related biomechanical and vascular constraints limit the trait combinations that are physically possible. This suggests that the leaf size spectrum overrules more subtle variation caused by the leaf economics spectrum, and that leaf size represents a more important strategy axis than previously thought.},

  abstract = {To study the acclimation responses of the leaves of saplings of six tree species when changed to low or high levels of irradiance, we carried out a light exposure experiment. Species representative of contrasting shade tolerance groups were identified across a light gradient in the understorey of a Venezuelan Andean cloud forest. Measured traits included gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and morphoanatomical, biochemical and optical properties. Saplings were grown for 6 months in a shade-house receiving 20\% photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) of full sunlight. Plant samples were then moved to shade-houses receiving low PPF (4\%) or high PPF (65\%). A factorial model (species × PPF), with repeated measurements (0, 15 and 120 days) was designed. Our results showed that morphological and anatomical traits were more plastic to PPF changes than photosynthetic traits. All species were susceptible to photoinhibition (15 days): shade-intolerant species showed dynamic photoinhibition (120 days), whereas shade-tolerant species presented chronic photoinhibition and the consequent inability to increase C assimilation rates under high PPF. The partially shade-tolerant species showed mixed responses; nonetheless, they exhibited larger adjustments in morphoanatomical and optical properties. Thus the acclimation responses of these species when subject to contrasting light conditions could help to explain their distribution along the light gradient in the understorey.},

  abstract = {This comparative study examines the ecophysiology of four endemic plant species abundant in the coastal temperate rainforests of Prince William Sound, Alaska. Photosynthesis in Alnus crispa ssp. sinuate (Betulaceae), Rubus spectabilis (Rosaceae), Vaccinium alaskaense and V. ovalifolium (Ericaceae) was measured with a MINI-Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometer. A. sinuate (sun) and R. spectabilis (partial shade) had higher photosynthetic capacities (maximum apparent photosynthetic electron transport rates, ETRmax) and higher light saturation intensities (Ik) than V. alaskaense (partial shade) and V. ovalifolium (shade). A. sinuate was less sensitive to photoprotective down regulation through the xanthophyll cycle (qE) than R. spectabilis. Vaccinium species showed similar photosynthetic characteristics except V. ovalifolium was sensitive qE while V. alaskaense was not. A comparison of A. sinuate trees growing in the ‘sun’ versus ‘shade’ revealed sun trees had higher ETRmax and Ik than shade trees. High photochemical quenching (qP; 0.893–0.978), associated with photochemical productivity, measured along with low non-photochemical quenching (qN; 0.252–0.678) at Ik revealed shade plants are acclimated to low ambient light, and have limited use for qN. Nonetheless, at higher light intensities, all species are ready to safely dissipate excess light in non-photochemical quenching to heat based on qN (\textasciitilde 0.6–0.8) and NPQ (\textasciitilde 0.7–2.6). These findings illustrate the adaptive responses of plants growing at high latitudes with respect to photoacclimation. Differences between plants were correlated to their position along the natural light gradient created by the forest canopy.},

  abstract = {Evergreen broad-leaved tropical forests can have high rates of productivity and large accumulations of carbon in plant biomass and soils. They can therefore play an important role in the global carbon cycle, influencing atmospheric CO2 concentrations if climate warms. We applied meta-analyses to published data to evaluate the apparent effects of temperature on carbon fluxes and storages in mature, moist tropical evergreen forest ecosystems. Among forests, litter production, tree growth, and belowground carbon allocation all increased significantly with site mean annual temperature (MAT); total net primary productivity (NPP) increased by an estimated 0.2–0.7 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1·°C−1. Temperature had no discernible effect on the turnover rate of aboveground forest biomass, which averaged 0.014 yr−1 among sites. Consistent with these findings, forest biomass increased with site MAT at a rate of 5–13 Mg C·ha−1·°C−1. Despite greater productivity in warmer forests, soil organic matter accumulations decreased with site MAT, with a slope of −8 Mg C·ha−1·°C−1, indicating that decomposition rates of soil organic matter increased with MAT faster than did rates of NPP. Turnover rates of surface litter also increased with temperature among forests. We found no detectable effect of temperature on total carbon storage among moist tropical evergreen forests, but rather a shift in ecosystem structure, from low-biomass forests with relatively large accumulations of detritus in cooler sites, to large-biomass forests with relatively smaller detrital stocks in warmer locations. These results imply that, in a warmer climate, conservation of forest biomass will be critical to the maintenance of carbon stocks in moist tropical forests.},

All measurements were taken on leaves from upper and lower parts of the canopy of mature trees (\&gt;85 years old) growing at low (400\hspace{0.25em}m above sea level, a.s.l.), middle (720\hspace{0.25em}m a.s.l.) and high (1100\hspace{0.25em}m a.s.l.) altitudes. Compared with trees at higher altitudes, those growing at low altitudes had lower stomatal conductance, slightly lower CO2 assimilation rate (Amax) and leaf mass per area (LMA), and higher photochemical reflectance index, water-use efficiency and Rubisco content. Given similar stand densities at all altitudes, the different growth conditions result in a more open canopy and higher penetration of light into lower canopy with increasing altitude. Even though strong vertical gradients in light intensity occurred across the canopy at all altitudes, lower canopy leaves at high altitudes tended to acquire the same morphological, biochemical and physiological traits as did upper leaves. While elevation had no significant effect on nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) contents per unit leaf area, LMA, or total content of chlorophylls and epidermal flavonoids in upper leaves, these increased significantly in lower leaves at higher altitudes. The increases in N content of lower leaves were coupled with similar changes in Amax. Moreover, a high N content coincided with high Rubisco concentrations in lower but not in upper canopy leaves. Our results show that the limiting role of light in lower parts of the canopy is reduced at high altitudes. A great capacity of trees to adjust the entire canopy is thus demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Restoring Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests after a century of fire suppression has become an important management priority as fuel reduction thinning has been mandated by the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. However, in mechanically thinned stands there is little information on the effects of different patterns and densities of live-tree retention on forest canopy microclimate. This study compared gradients of air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) through the vertical forest profile among an overstory-thin, an understory-thin, an un-thinned control, and a riparian environment in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest. Temperature and humidity were recorded for a year by 60 data loggers arrayed in 12 trees at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 m above the forest floor. Both thinning treatments had significantly more extreme summer daily ranges of temperature and VPD than the control across heights. The overstory-thin resulted in the greatest maximum temperatures, VPDs, and VPD range among all sensors at 5 m, and significantly higher summer maximum temperatures and VPDs than the control in lower strata ( 15 m). The understory-thin also had significantly higher summer maximum temperatures than the control ( 15 m), but these too were significantly less than in the overstory-thin nearest the surface at 5 m. Understory thinning did not alter the mean or range of microclimate as much as overstory thinning. Riparian microclimate had significantly lower minimums and means, and greater daily ranges of temperatures and VPDs than the control. Results suggest that thinning canopy cover significantly increases the extremes and variability of understory microclimate compared to thinning from below and no-thin treatments.},

Mixing-layer turbulence, formed around the inflectional mean velocity profile which develops between two coflowing streams of different velocities, differs in several ways from turbulence in a surface layer. Through these differences, the mixing-layer analogy provides an explanation for many of the observed distinctive features of canopy turbulence. These include: (a) ratios between components of the Reynolds stress tensor; (b) the ratio K-H/K-M of the eddy diffusivities for heat and momentum; (c) the relative roles of ejections and sweeps; (d) the behaviour of the turbulent energy balance, particularly the major role of turbulent transport; and (e) the behaviour of the turbulent length scales of the active coherent motions (the dominant eddies responsible for vertical transfer near the top of the canopy). It is predicted that these length scales are controlled by the shear length scale L(s)=U(h)/U'(h) (where h is canopy height, U(z) is mean velocity as a function of height z, and U'=dU/dz). In particular, the streamwise spacing of the dominant canopy eddies is Lambda(x)=mL(s), with m=8.1. These predictions are tested against many sets of field and wind-tunnel data. We propose a picture of canopy turbulence in which eddies associated with inflectional instabilities are modulated by larger-scale, inactive turbulence, which is quasi-horizontal on the scale of the canopy.},

  abstract = {Net photosynthesis was measured in foliage of Tasmanian rainforest canopy species grown at 20°C and acclimated sequentially to a range of temperatures. Some trends in photosynthetic response (both instantaneous and acclimatory) correlated with aspects of species' distributions with respect to altitude, latitude and climate, and with their frost resistance. This was particularly evident in Athrotaxis selaginoides D.Don and Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst. which are common at high altitudes. High-altitude provenances of these species showed a low optimum acclimation temperature (16-17°C) and maintained a high rate of photosynthesis (as a proportion of their maximum rate) at 8°C (84\% and 76\% respectively). However, the co-occurring winter-deciduous Nothofagus gunnii (Hook. f.) Oerst. showed a higher optimum acclimation temperature for photosynthesis (23°C) and a lower rate of photosynthesis at 8°C (60\% of its maximum rate) and is apparently adapted photosynthetically to summer temperature conditions. Provenances of N. cunninghamii showed trends in photosynthetic responses (maxima and responses to extremes) and specific leaf area which correlated with the climate of the collection site and with frost resistance. This population variation may permit the very wide geographic and climatic range of this species, allowing tolerance of extreme temperatures as well as a relatively high competitive ability under more equable climates. Atherosperma moschatum Labill. showed a low photosynthetic tolerance of high and low temperatures compared with the other species. This is consistent with the general restriction of this species to microhabitats with an ameliorated climate and indicates that its wide latitudinal range is not due to a broader photosynthetic tolerance of temperature than co-occurring species. The determinants of the narrow latitudinal range of the Tasmanian endemic species, particularly those which are common at low altitudes (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius (Labill.) Hook, f., Eucryphia lucida (Labill.) Baill. and Lagarostrobos franklinii (Hook. f.) C.J. Quinn are less clear. Limited acclimation to high temperatures in E. lucida (and P. aspleniifolius under some conditions), and in the high altitude species, N. gunnii and A. selaginoides, suggests that the sensitivity of these species to high summer temperatures may directly limit their distribution. However, interpretation of the sensitivity of these species to high summer temperatures and low precipitation shown by the climate analysis is complicated by the interactions of these climatic features with the incidence of fire.},

  abstract = {Leaf life span is an important plant trait associated with interspecific variation in leaf, organismal, and ecosystem processes. We hypothesized that intraspecific variation in gymnosperm needle traits with latitude reflects both selection and acclimation for traits adaptive to the associated temperature and moisture gradient. This hypothesis was supported, because across 127 sites along a 2,160-km gradient in North America individuals of Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, and Abies balsamea had longer needle life span and lower tissue nitrogen concentration with decreasing mean annual temperature. Similar patterns were noted for Pinus sylvestris across a north–south gradient in Europe. These differences highlight needle longevity as an adaptive feature important to ecological success of boreal conifers across broad climatic ranges. Additionally, differences in leaf life span directly affect annual foliage turnover rate, which along with needle physiology partially regulates carbon cycling through effects on gross primary production and net canopy carbon export. However, most, if not all, global land surface models parameterize needle longevity of boreal evergreen forests as if it were a constant. We incorporated temperature-dependent needle longevity and \%nitrogen, and biomass allocation, into a land surface model, Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange, to assess their impacts on carbon cycling processes. Incorporating realistic parameterization of these variables improved predictions of canopy leaf area index and gross primary production compared with observations from flux sites. Finally, increasingly low foliage turnover and biomass fraction toward the cold far north indicate that a surprisingly small fraction of new biomass is allocated to foliage under such conditions.},

  abstract = {Eddy covariance and sapflow data from three Mediterranean ecosystems were analysed via top-down approaches in conjunction with a mechanistic ecosystem gas-exchange model to test current assumptions about drought effects on ecosystem respiration and canopy CO2/H2O exchange. The three sites include two nearly monospecific Quercus ilex L. forests – one on karstic limestone (Puéchabon), the other on fluvial sand with access to ground water (Castelporziano) – and a typical mixed macchia on limestone (Arca di Noè). Estimates of ecosystem respiration were derived from light response curves of net ecosystem CO2 exchange. Subsequently, values of ecosystem gross carbon uptake were computed from eddy covariance CO2 fluxes and estimates of ecosystem respiration as a function of soil temperature and moisture. Bulk canopy conductance was calculated by inversion of the Penman-Monteith equation. In a top-down analysis, it was shown that all three sites exhibit similar behaviour in terms of their overall response to drought. In contrast to common assumptions, at all sites ecosystem respiration revealed a decreasing temperature sensitivity (Q10) in response to drought. Soil temperature and soil water content explained 70–80\% of the seasonal variability of ecosystem respiration. During the drought, light-saturated ecosystem gross carbon uptake and day-time averaged canopy conductance declined by up to 90\%. These changes were closely related to soil water content. Ecosystem water-use efficiency of gross carbon uptake decreased during the drought, regardless whether evapotranspiration from eddy covariance or transpiration from sapflow had been used for the calculation. We evidence that this clearly contrasts current models of canopy function which predict increasing ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) during the drought. Four potential explanations to those results were identified (patchy stomatal closure, changes in physiological capacities of photosynthesis, decreases in mesophyll conductance for CO2, and photoinhibition), which will be tested in a forthcoming paper. It is suggested to incorporate the new findings into current biogeochemical models after further testing as this will improve estimates of climate change effects on (semi)arid ecosystems' carbon balances.},

  abstract = {Plants often adjust their leaf mitochondrial (‘dark’) respiration (Rd) measured at a standardized temperature such as 20°C (R20) downward after experiencing warmer temperatures and upward after experiencing cooler temperatures. These responses may help leaves maintain advantageous photosynthetic capacity and/or be a response to recent photosynthate accumulation, and can occur within days after a change in thermal regime. It is not clear however, how the sensitivity and magnitude of this response changes over time, or which time period prior to a given measurement best predicts R20. Nor is it known whether nighttime, daytime or 24-hour temperatures should be most influential. To address these issues, we used data from 1,620 Rd temperature response curves of ten temperate and boreal tree species in a long–term field experiment in Minnesota, USA to assess how the observed nearly complete acclimation of R20 was related to past temperatures during periods of differing lengths. Inconsistent with our hypothesis that R20 would be best related to daytime temperatures, prior night temperatures were the best predictors of R20 for all species. We had also hypothesized that recent (prior 3–10 day) temperatures should best predict R20 because they likely have stronger residual impacts on leaf-level physiology than periods extending further back in time, whereas a 1–2 day prior period might be a span shorter than one to which photosynthetic capacity and Rd adjust. There was little to no support for this idea, as for angiosperms, long time windows (prior 30–60 nights) were the best predictors, while for gymnosperms both near-term (prior 5–8 nights for pines, prior 8–15 nights for spruce/fir) and longer-term periods (prior 45 nights) were the best predictors. The importance of night-time temperatures, the relatively long ‘time-averaging’ that best explained acclimation, and dual peaks of temporal acclimation responsiveness in some species, were all results that were unanticipated.},

  abstract = {Understanding leaf temperature (Tleaf) variation in the canopy of tropical forests is critical for accurately calculating net primary productivity because plant respiration and net photosynthesis are highly sensitive to temperature. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatiotemporal variation of Tleaf in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama and (2) create a season-specific empirical model to predict Tleaf in the canopy. To achieve this, we used a 42 m tall construction crane for canopy access and monitored the microenvironment within the canopy of mature, 20−35 m tall trees of 5 tropical tree species during the wet and the dry season. Tleaf was correlated to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the wet season but not in the dry season, possibly due to seasonal differences in wind speed, physiology, and canopy phenology. A structural equation model showed that Tleaf is best explained by air temperature (Tair) and PPFD in the wet season, whereas in the dry season, Tair alone predicted most of the variation in Tleaf. These results suggest the utility of an empirical approach to estimate Tleaf variability where simple meteorological data are available. This approach can be incorporated in future models of vegetation−atmosphere carbon and water exchange models of mature tropical forests with similar seasonality.},

Specifically, we focus on patterns of leaf budburst, expansion, coloration and fall, in the context of differences between canopy and understory species, and between canopy and understory individuals of the same species. Many understory species appear to adopt a strategy of “phenological escape” in spring but not autumn, taking advantage of the high-light period in spring before canopy development. For all but a few of these species, the spring escape period is very brief. Relationships between canopy and understory conspecifics (i.e. individuals of the same species) varied among species, with leaf budburst and leaf fall occurring earlier in understory individuals of some species, but later in other species. We fit standard models of varying complexity to the budburst time series for each species to investigate whether biological responses to environmental cues differed among species. While there was no clear consensus model, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that a simple two-parameter “Spring warming” model was best supported by the data for more than a third of all species, and well supported for two-thirds of all species. More highly-parameterized models involving various chilling requirements (e.g., Alternating, Parallel or Sequential chilling) were less well supported by the data. Species-specific model parameterization suggested that responses to both chilling and forcing temperatures vary among species. While there were no obvious differences in this regard between canopy and understory species, or between early- and late-budburst species, these results imply that species can be expected to differ in their responses to future climate change.},

Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography. 2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values.

  abstract = {A global land–ocean temperature record has been created by combining the Berkeley Earth monthly land temperature field with spatially kriged version of the HadSST3 dataset. This combined product spans the period from 1850 to present and covers the majority of the Earth’s surface: approximately 57 \% in 1850, 75 \% in 1880, 95 \% in 1960, and 99.9 \% by 2015. It includes average temperatures in 1◦ × 1◦ lat–long grid cells for each month when available. It provides a global mean temperature record quite similar to records from Hadley’s HadCRUT4, NASA’s GISTEMP, NOAA’s GlobalTemp, and Cowtan and Way and provides a spatially complete and homogeneous temperature field. Two versions of the record are provided, treating areas with sea ice cover as either air temperature over sea ice or sea surface temperature under sea ice, the former being preferred for most applications. The choice of how to assess the temperature of areas with sea ice coverage has a notable impact on global anomalies over past decades due to rapid warming of air temperatures in the Arctic. Accounting for rapid warming of Arctic air suggests ∼ 0.1 ◦C additional global-average temperature rise since the 19th century than temperature series that do not capture the changes in the Arctic. Updated versions of this dataset will be presented each month at the Berkeley Earth website (http://berkeleyearth.org/data/, last access: November 2020), and a convenience copy of the version discussed in this paper has been archived and is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3634713 (Rohde and Hausfather, 2020).},

  abstract = {The response of understory trees to climate variability is key to understanding current and future forest dynamics. However, analyses of climatic effects on tree growth have primarily focused on the upper canopy, leaving understory dynamics unresolved. We analyzed differences in climate sensitivity based on canopy position of four common tree species (Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) using growth information from 1084 trees across eight sites in the northeastern United States. Effects of canopy position on climate response varied, but were significant and often non-linear, for all four species. Compared to overstory trees, understory trees showed stronger reductions in growth at high temperatures and varied shifts in precipitation response. This contradicts the prevailing assumption that climate responses, particularly to temperature, of understory trees are buffered by the overstory. Forest growth trajectories are uncertain in compositionally and structurally complex forests, and future demography and regeneration dynamics may be misinferred if not all canopy levels are represented in future forecasts.},

The aim of this work is to investigate the impact of weather conditions on the magnitude of shade avoidance responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. We first generated a growth rate database under controlled conditions and elaborated a model that predicts daytime hypocotyl growth as a function of the activity of the main photosensory receptors (phytochromes A and B, cryptochromes 1 and 2) in combination with light and temperature inputs. We then incorporated the action of thermal amplitude to account for its effect on selected genotypes, which correlates with the dynamics of the growth-promoting transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4. The model predicted growth rate in the field with reasonable accuracy. Thus, we used the model in combination with a worldwide data set of current and future whether conditions. The analysis predicted enhanced shade avoidance responses as a result of higher temperatures due to the geographical location or global warming. Irradiance and thermal amplitude had no effects. These trends were also observed for our local growth rate measurements. We conclude that, if water and nutrients do not become limiting, warm environments enhance the shade avoidance response.},

  abstract = {Land use and land cover changes greatly influence surface energy balance and consequently climate, and are likely to be associated with the persistent predictions of warming and drying throughout the Mediterranean and other regions. We specifically address the question of how the high radiation load and suppressed latent heat flux, intrinsic to dry regions, interact with land use changes and climate in these environments. We use for this purpose a detailed 6-year (2003–2008) study of the redistribution of the radiation load in an open-canopy pine forest. The results show that compared with the background shrubland, there was a 23.8 W m−2 increase in shortwave radiation load on the forest (to a mean annual net solar radiation of 211 W m−2) associated with a decrease in albedo of 0.1. Surface (skin) temperature in the forest was lower than in the shrubland (by ∼5 °C on average) due to an efficient ‘convector effect’ and the production of a large sensible heat flux (up to 926 W m−2 in summer), which effectively shifted heat from the canopy to the overlying boundary layer. The cooler forest skin temperature resulted in suppression of upwelling longwave radiation (by 25 W m−2, annual average), further increasing the forest radiation load (mean annual net radiation of 116 and 67 W m−2 for forest and shrubland, respectively). This suppression also resulted in a local ‘canopy greenhouse effect’, where upwelling longwave radiation from the ground to the canopy was larger than from the canopy to the atmosphere (by up to 150 W m−2 in summer) and was associated with ∼3 °C warming below the canopy. The ability of the dry productive forest to deal with the high radiation load indicates the potential for afforestation in dry areas.},

Some potential confounding factors have not been investigated with large data sets, limiting our understanding of the adaptive significance of leaf teeth and their reliability to reconstruct paleoclimate. Here we test the strength of correlations between leaf-margin state and deciduousness, leaf thickness, wood type (ring-porous vs. diffuse-porous), height within community, and several leaf economic variables. • Methods: We assembled a trait database for 3549 species from six continents based on published and original data. The strength of associations between traits was quantified using correlational and principal axes approaches. • Key results: Toothed species, independent of temperature, are more likely to be deciduous and to have thin leaves, a high leaf nitrogen concentration, a low leaf mass per area, and ring-porous wood. Canopy trees display the highest sensitivity between leaf-margin state and temperature; subcanopy plants, especially herbs, are less sensitive. • Conclusions: Our data support hypotheses linking the adaptive significance of teeth to leaf thickness and deciduousness (in addition to temperature). Toothed species associate with the “fast-return” end of the leaf economic spectrum, providing another functional link to thin leaves and the deciduous habit. Accounting for these confounding factors should improve climate estimates from tooth-based methods.},

  abstract = {Deciduous dipterocarp forests across mainland Southeast Asia are dominated by two families: the Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae. Monsoon conditions produce strong seasonal climates with a hot dry season of 5–7 months extending from late November or early December through April or early May. Seasonal measurements of stomatal conductance and plant water potential found important differences between members of the two families. Despite their long dry season, Shorea siamensis and S. obtusa (Dipterocarpaceae) showed little significant patterns of seasonal change in xylem water potentials, with midday potentials never dropping below −1.3 MPa. These species present a classic example of isohydric strategies of adaptation where stomatal regulation maintains a relatively stable minimum water potential over the course of the year. However, maximum rates of stomatal conductance dropped sharply in the late dry season as the leaves heated in full sun without significant transpirational cooling, reaching as high as 44–45 °C, making them potentially sensitive to global increases in extreme temperature. The woody legumes Xylia kerrii and Dalbergia oliveri present different patterns of seasonal water relations and leaf response to high temperatures. The legumes exhibit anisohydric behavior where water potential decreases over the dry season as evaporative demand increases. Dry season midday water potentials dropped from high wet season levels to −2.4 to −3.2 MPa, moderately lowering maximum stomatal conductance. The relatively small leaflets of these legumes responded to the high temperatures of the late dry season by temporarily wilting, reducing their exposure to solar radiation and taking advantage of convective cooling. Large leaf size of dipterocarps in this community may not be an adaptive trait but rather an ancestral condition compensated for with ecophysiological adaptations.},

  abstract = {Leaf lifespan , the time from leaf expansion to shedding, exhibits wide variation and is a key integrator of relationships with photosynthetic rate, leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen among coexisting tropical tree species. We present a hierarchical view of sources of variation in leaf lifespan in tropical forests, emphasizing the importance of substantial within-species variation, which has rarely been addressed. Interspecific variation in leaf lifespan is positively correlated with LMA, varying from short-lived, low-LMA leaves to long-lived, high-LMA leaves of species associated with resource-rich versus resource-depleted habitats, respectively. Phenotypic responses of leaf lifespan and LMA to light show counter-gradient variation: with acclimation to shade, leaf lifespan increases, and LMA decreases, but both increase with adaptation to shade. In contrast, phenotypic responses to soil fertility are predicted to show co-gradient variation: both leaf lifespan and LMA increase with declining fertility both inter- and intraspecifically. We present new data analyses supporting these predictions, but the interactive effects of light and soil resources can produce complex phenotypic responses. Future studies of leaf lifespan should devote more attention to within-species variation to better quantify and explain how leaf lifespan is central to trade-offs generating the contrasting ecological strategies of tropical tree species.},

  abstract = {Intracanopy plasticity in tree leaf form is a major determinant of whole-plant function and potentially of forest understory ecology. However, there exists little systematic information for the full extent of intracanopy plasticity, whether it is linked with height and exposure, or its variation across species. For arboretum-grown trees of six temperate deciduous species averaging 13–18 m in height, we quantified intracanopy plasticity for 11 leaf traits across three canopy locations (basal-interior, basal-exterior, and top). Plasticity was pronounced across the canopy, and maximum likelihood analyses indicated that plasticity was primarily linked with irradiance, regardless of height. Intracanopy plasticity (the quotient of values for top and basal-interior leaves) was often similar across species and statistically indistinguishable across species for several key traits. At canopy tops, the area of individual leaves was on average 0.5–0.6 times that at basal-interior, stomatal density 1.1–1.5 times higher, sapwood cross-sectional area up to 1.7 times higher, and leaf mass per area 1.5–2.2 times higher; guard cell and stomatal pore lengths were invariant across the canopy. Species differed in intracanopy plasticity for the mass of individual leaves, leaf margin dissection, ratio of leaf to sapwood areas, and stomatal pore area per leaf area; plasticity quotients ranged only up to ≈2. Across the six species, trait plasticities were uncorrelated and independent of the magnitude of the canopy gradient in irradiance or height and of the species' light requirements for regeneration. This convergence across species indicates general optimization or constraints in development, resulting in a bounded plasticity that improves canopy performance.},

Klamina was measured for sun and shade leaves of six woody temperate species growing in moist soil, and tested for correlation with the prevailing leaf irradiance, and with 22 other leaf traits. Klamina varied from 7.40 × 10−5 kg m−2 s−1 MPa−1 for Acer saccharum shade leaves to 2.89 × 10−4 kg m−2 s−1 MPa−1 for Vitis labrusca sun leaves. Tree sun leaves had 15–67\% higher Klamina than shade leaves. Klamina was co-ordinated with traits associated with high water flux, including leaf irradiance, petiole hydraulic conductance, guard cell length, and stomatal pore area per lamina area. Klamina was also co-ordinated with lamina thickness, water storage capacitance, 1/mesophyll water transfer resistance, and, in five of the six species, with lamina perimeter/area. However, for the six species, Klamina was independent of inter-related leaf traits including leaf dry mass per area, density, modulus of elasticity, osmotic potential, and cuticular conductance. Klamina was thus co-ordinated with structural and functional traits relating to liquid-phase water transport and to maximum rates of gas exchange, but independent of other traits relating to drought tolerance and to aspects of carbon economy.},

  abstract = {We review the current understanding of the temperature responses of C3 and C4 photosynthesis across thermal ranges that do not harm the photosynthetic apparatus. In C3 species, photosynthesis is classically considered to be limited by the capacities of ribulose 1·5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration or Pi regeneration. Using both theoretical and empirical evidence, we describe the temperature response of instantaneous net CO2 assimilation rate (A) in terms of these limitations, and evaluate possible limitations on A at elevated temperatures arising from heat-induced lability of Rubisco activase. In C3 plants, Rubisco capacity is the predominant limitation on A across a wide range of temperatures at low CO2 ({$<$}300 µbar), while at elevated CO2, the limitation shifts to Pi regeneration capacity at suboptimal temperatures, and either electron transport capacity or Rubisco activase capacity at supraoptimal temperatures. In C4 plants, Rubisco capacity limits A below 20 °C in chilling-tolerant species, but the control over A at elevated temperature remains uncertain. Acclimation of C3 photosynthesis to suboptimal growth temperature is commonly associated with a disproportional enhancement of the Pi regeneration capacity. Above the thermal optimum, acclimation of A to increasing growth temperature is associated with increased electron transport capacity and/or greater heat stability of Rubisco activase. In many C4 species from warm habitats, acclimation to cooler growth conditions increases levels of Rubisco and C4 cycle enzymes which then enhance A below the thermal optimum. By contrast, few C4 species adapted to cooler habitats increase Rubisco content during acclimation to reduced growth temperature; as a result, A changes little at suboptimal temperatures. Global change is likely to cause a widespread shift in patterns of photosynthetic limitation in higher plants. Limitations in electron transport and Rubisco activase capacity should be more common in the warmer, high CO2 conditions expected by the end of the century.},

  abstract = {Cariniana legalis is an emergent tree that reaches the upper canopy in Brazilian Semideciduous Forest. Spatial contrasts in microclimatic conditions between the upper canopy and understorey in a forest may affect morpho-physiological leaf traits. In order to test the hypothesis that the upper canopy is more stressful to leaves than a gap environment we compared emergent trees of C.~legalis, 28–29~m in height to gap saplings, 6–9~m in height, for the following parameters: leaf area, leaf mass area (LMA the dry weight:leaf area ratio), leaf thickness, leaf anatomical parameters, stomata conductance, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. Leaves from emergent trees had smaller leaf areas but greater LMA compared to saplings. Leaf thickness, palisade layer thickness, and stomatal density were higher for emergent trees than for saplings. The opposite pattern was observed for spongy layer thickness and spongy/palisade ratio. Stomatal conductance was also higher for emergent tree leaves than for sapling leaves, but the magnitude of depression on stomatal conductance near midday was more pronounced in emergent trees. The potential quantum yield of photosystem II, as determined by the Fv/Fm ratio was lower for leaves from saplings. The lower values of stomatal conductance, indicating restriction in CO2 diffusion into the mesophyll can be related to higher photoinhibition observed in the saplings. Leaves from emergent trees and saplings exhibited similar values for apparent electron transport rates and non-photochemical quenching. Our results suggest that changes in leaf traits could be associated to dry conditions at the upper canopy as well as to the ontogenetic transition between sapling/emergent tree life stages.},

  abstract = {Although trees have responded to global warming in the past – to temperatures higher than they are now – the rate of change predicted in the 21st century is likely to be unprecedented. Greenhouse gas emissions could cause a 3–6°C increase in mean land surface temperature at high and temperate latitudes. Despite this, few experiments have isolated the effects of temperature for this scenario on trees and forests. This review focuses on tree and forest responses at boreal and temperate latitudes, ranging from the cellular to the ecosystem level. Adaptation to varying temperatures revolves around the trade-off between utilizing the full growing season and minimizing frost damage through proper timing of hardening in autumn and dehardening in spring. But the evolutionary change in these traits must be sufficiently rapid to compensate for the temperature changes. Many species have a positive response to increased temperature – but how close are we to the optima? Management is critical for a positive response of forest growth to a warmer climate, and selection of the best species for the new conditions will be of vital importance. Contents Summary 369 I.

  abstract = {Mitochondrial respiration (R) is central to plant physiology and responds dynamically to daily short-term temperature changes. In the longer-term, changes in energy demand and membrane fluidity can decrease leaf R at a common temperature and increase the temperature at which leaf R peaks (Tmax). However, leaf R functionality is more susceptible to short-term heatwaves. Catalysis increases with rising leaf temperature, driving faster metabolism and leaf R demand, despite declines in photosynthesis restricting assimilate supply and growth. Proteins denature as temperatures increase further, adding to maintenance costs. Excessive heat also inactivates respiratory enzymes, with a concomitant limitation on the capacity of the R system. These competing push-and-pull factors are responsible for the diminishing acceleration in leaf R rate as temperature rises. Under extreme heat, membranes become overly fluid, and enzymes such as the cytochrome c oxidase are impaired. Such changes can lead to over-reduction of the energy system culminating in reactive oxygen species production. This ultimately leads to the total breakdown of leaf R, setting the limit of leaf survival. Understanding the heat stress responses of leaf R is imperative, given the continued rise in frequency and intensity of heatwaves and the importance of R for plant fitness and survival.},

  abstract = {Variation in stomatal conductance is typically explained in relation to environmental conditions. However, tree height may also contribute to the variability in mean stomatal conductance. Mean canopy stomatal conductance of individual tree crowns (GSi) was estimated using sap flux measurements in Fagus sylvatica L., and the hypothesis that GSi decreases with tree height was tested. Over 13 d of the growing season during which soil moisture was not limiting, GSi decreased linearly with the natural logarithm of vapour pressure deficit (D), and increased exponentially to saturation with photosynthetic photon flux density (Qo). Under conditions of D= 1 kPa and saturating Qo, GSi decreased by approximately 60\% with 30 m increase in tree height. Over the same range in height, sapwood-to-leaf area ratio (AS:AL) doubled. A simple hydraulic model explained the variation in GSi based on an inverse relationship with height, and a linear relationship with AS:AL. Thus, in F. sylvatica, adjustments in AS:AL partially compensate for the negative effect of increased flow-path length on leaf conductance. Furthermore, because stomata with low conductance are less sensitive to D, gas exchange of tall trees is reduced less by high D. Despite these compensations, decreasing hydraulic conductance with tree height in F. sylvatica reduces carbon uptake through a corresponding decrease in stomatal conductance.},

  abstract = {Extreme weather events, such as unusually hot or dry conditions, can cause death by exceeding physiological limits, and so cause loss of population. Survival will depend on whether or not susceptible organisms can find refuges that buffer extreme conditions. Microhabitats offer different microclimates to those found within the wider ecosystem, but do these microhabitats effectively buffer extreme climate events relative to the physiological requirements of the animals that frequent them? We collected temperature data from four common microhabitats (soil, tree holes, epiphytes and vegetation) located from the ground to canopy in primary rainforests in the Philippines. Ambient temperatures were monitored from outside of each microhabitat and from the upper forest canopy, which represent our macrohabitat controls. We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTmax ) of frog and lizard species, which are thermally sensitive and inhabit our microhabitats. Microhabitats reduced mean temperature by 1-2°C and reduced the duration of extreme temperature exposure by 14 to 31 times. Microhabitat temperatures were below the CTmax of inhabitant frogs and lizards, whereas macrohabitats consistently contained lethal temperatures. Microhabitat temperatures increased by 0.11 to 0.66°C for every 1°C increase in macrohabitat temperature, and this non-uniformity in temperature change influenced our forecasts of vulnerability for animal communities under climate change. Assuming uniform increases of 6°C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 32-fold, whereas under non-uniform increases of 0.66 to 3.96°C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 108-fold. Microhabitats have extraordinary potential to buffer climate and likely reduce mortality during extreme climate events. These results suggest that predicted changes in distribution due to mortality and habitat shifts that are derived from macroclimatic samples and that assume uniform changes in microclimates relative to macroclimates may be overly pessimistic. Nevertheless, even non-uniform temperature increases within buffered microhabitats would still threaten frogs and lizards. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Most climate change projections for Central Europe predict higher mean summer temperatures and prolonged summer drought periods. However, in diverse mixed forest stands we expect tree species specific responses to water shortage, as tree species are highly variable in rooting depth and physiological traits related to the water balance. Here, we assessed the drought sensitivity of the water relations of six deciduous forest tree species at four sites with contrasting water availability by airborne thermal imagery of canopy foliage temperature, sap flow and soil water potential. Canopy architecture had a consistent influence on canopy foliage temperature with ‘dense canopy’ species (Acer pseudoplatanus, Fagus sylvatica and Tilia platyphyllos) being warmer (0.5–1.5K) than ‘open canopy’ species (Fraxinus excelsior, Prunus avium and Quercus petraea). While the canopy foliage was close to air temperature at the beginning of the drought period (ΔTC−A=−0.1 to 0.7K) it strongly warmed up with ongoing drought, especially at the two ‘dry’ sites with a ΔTC−A of 3.5–5K. The pronounced canopy foliage warming at the ‘dry’ sites after 22 days of drought was associated with reduced transpiration rates as sap flow was curtailed by 20–35\% in all species except F. excelsior and Q. petraea. Based on canopy foliage temperature and sap flow data, we considered A. pseudoplatanus the most drought sensitive species followed by F. sylvatica, T. platyphyllos and P. avium and the two ring-porous species F. excelsior and Q. petraea being clearly the least sensitive ones. At drier sites, increasing summer temperatures and drought might change the competitive abilities of tree species in favour of those that are able to maintain transpirational fluxes and cooler canopies such as F. excelsior and Q. petraea.},

  abstract = {Leaves within a canopy may experience rapid and extreme fluctuations in ambient conditions. A shaded leaf, for example, may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds, due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments, (2 to 60 minutes), the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations, the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid over-heating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought. Our results also suggest that typical leaf water contents could sustain several minutes of evaporative cooling during a sunfleck without increasing the xylem water supply and thus risking embolism. We thus submit that shaded leaves rely on hydraulic capacitance and evaporative cooling to avoid over-heating and hydraulic failure during exposure to typical sunflecks, whereas thermal capacitance provides limited protection for very short sunflecks (tens of seconds).},

  abstract = {Ontogenetic changes in leaf phenology of a hardwood tree,Acer mono, were investigated in individuals in different size classes in a temperate forest. Leaf emergence was earliest in current-year seedlings, and was increasingly delayed with increasing height of the individual. The shorter the tree, the longer the duration of leaf emergence. Timing of leaf emergence of the dominant heterospecific canopy trees was almost identical to that of conspecific adults; understorey light then gradually decreased with expansion of canopy leaves. These traits indicate that smaller individuals that receive the least light in summer can acquire favourable light for a longer period in spring than taller plants even in a forest understorey, but the advantage decreases with increasing plant height. Changes in the duration of leaf emergence and leaf longevity in response to environmental light regime [sun (forest edge)vs. shade (forest understorey)], were greatest for current year seedlings but decreased with increasing plant height. These results suggest that the plastic response of leaf phenology in juvenile stages may reduce the risk of losing an entire cohort in spatially heterogenous environments in the understorey of temperate forests.},

  abstract = {A study was performed on saplings of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) growing at the free air humidity manipulation site, which was established to investigate the effect of increased air humidity on tree performance and canopy functioning. The aim of the experiment was to simulate the impact of the increasing atmospheric humidity on forest ecosystems predicted for northern Europe. Artificially elevated relative humidity (RH), which causes transpirational flux to decrease, diminished nutrient supply to the foliage; leaf nitrogen content, phosphorus content and P:N ratio decreased. The changes in leaf nutritional status brought about a considerable decline in both photosynthetic capacity (Amax, Vcmax, Jmax) and tree growth rate. The manipulation induced diverse changes in tree hydraulic architecture and other functional traits. Different segments of the soil-to-leaf water transport pathway responded differently: leaf hydraulic conductance (KL) decreased, while hydraulic conductance of root systems (KR) and leaf-specific conductivity of stem-wood increased in response to elevated RH. Humidification caused the Huber values of stems to increase, thus reflecting changes in allocation patterns; relatively more resources were allocated to vascular tissue and less to foliage. The elevated RH induced substantial changes in specific leaf area (increased), branch- (decreased) and stem-wood density (decreased). The observed responses suggest that the expected climate-change-induced increase in the growth rate of trees at northern latitudes (boreal areas) due to the earlier start of the growing season in spring or higher carbon assimilation rate could be smaller or null if temperature rise is accompanied by a rise in atmospheric absolute humidity.},

  abstract = {Sap flux density (FLA) in branches of Betula pendula trees was examined with respect to environmental variables and canopy position. FLA of branches sampled within the basal and top thirds of crowns was analysed with respect to stomatal (gs), canopy (gc) and soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (KT). The canopy positions differed significantly (P {$<$} 0·001) by FLA: the day-time values in the upper canopy were on average 1·8 times greater than in the lower canopy (59·2 vs 33·2 g m−2 h−1), associated with greater gs, gc and KT observed in the upper canopy. The differences in gc among the canopy positions resulted primarily from a ∼10-fold greater aerodynamic boundary-layer conductance (gbl) in the upper canopy (mean gbl was 1695 vs 161 mmol m−2 s−1, respectively) in the day time. The asymptotic nature of gs versus gc relationship observed in the lower canopy suggests that stomata limit transpiration from the shade foliage at higher gbl. The linear relationship (R2 = 0·49–0·58, P {$<$} 0·001) between KT and FLA alludes to the role of hydraulic capacity in the control of sap fluxes. The dominant environmental factor affecting FLA in the day time was irradiance, and air relative humidity at night. The strong dependence of FLA on atmospheric evaporative demand in the night time proved that nocturnal branch sap flow indeed represents transpiration, but not tissue water recharge. Nocturnal FLA was about 24·7 and 19·5\% of the respective mean day-time rates for the upper and lower canopy. Owing to short northern nights in summer, nocturnal transpiration constituted only 6–8\% of the daily total water loss. The variation in branch-level sap flow is determined not merely by environmental gradients existing within the forest canopy, but depends largely on trees' internal properties, including stomatal conductance and plant hydraulic properties.

However, likely responses of tropical rainforests are poorly understood due to a lack of frequent long-term measurements of forest structure and dynamics. We analyzed a 12-year record (1999–2010) of 47 817 annual measurements of canopy height to characterize the response of an old-growth Neotropical rainforest to the severe heat and drought associated with the 1997–1998 El Niño. Well-drained soils on slopes and plateaus experienced a threefold increase in the fraction of the landscape in gaps (≤2 m) and a reduction in the fraction in high canopy ({$>$}15 m) causing distributions of canopy height to depart from equilibrium for a period of 2–3 years. In contrast, forests on low-lying alluvial terraces remained in equilibrium and were nearly half as likely to experience upper canopy ({$>$}15 m) disturbance over the 12 years of observation. Variation in forest response across topographic positions suggests that tropical rainforests are more sensitive to moisture deficits than high temperature and that topography likely structures landscape-level variation in the severity of drought impacts.},

  abstract = {Plants emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) causing transcriptomic, metabolomic and behavioral responses in receiver organisms. Volatiles involved in such responses are often called “plant language”. Arthropods having sensitive chemoreceptors can recognize language released by plants. Insect herbivores, pollinators and natural enemies respond to composition of volatiles from plants with specialized receptors responding to different types of compounds. In contrast, the mechanism of how plants “hear” volatiles has remained obscured. In a plant-plant communication, several individually emitted compounds are known to prime defense response in receiver plants with a specific manner according to the chemical structure of each volatile compound. Further, composition and ratio of volatile compounds in the plant-released plume is important in plant-insect and plant-plant interactions mediated by plant volatiles. Studies on volatile-mediated plant-plant signaling indicate that the signaling distances are rather short, usually not longer than one meter. Volatile communication from plants to insects such as pollinators could be across distances of hundreds of meters. As many of the herbivore induced VOCs have rather short atmospheric life times, we suggest that in long-distant communications with plant volatiles, reaction products in the original emitted compounds may have additional information value of the distance to emission source together with the original plant-emitted compounds.},

  abstract = {Aim Large trees (d.b.h. ≥ 70 cm) store large amounts of biomass. Several studies suggest that large trees may be vulnerable to changing climate, potentially leading to declining forest biomass storage. Here we determine the importance of large trees for tropical forest biomass storage and explore which intrinsic (species trait) and extrinsic (environment) variables are associated with the density of large trees and forest biomass at continental and pan-tropical scales. Location Pan-tropical. Methods Aboveground biomass (AGB) was calculated for 120 intact lowland moist forest locations. Linear regression was used to calculate variation in AGB explained by the density of large trees. Akaike information criterion weights (AICc-wi) were used to calculate averaged correlation coefficients for all possible multiple regression models between AGB/density of large trees and environmental and species trait variables correcting for spatial autocorrelation. Results Density of large trees explained c. 70\% of the variation in pan-tropical AGB and was also responsible for significantly lower AGB in Neotropical [287.8 (mean) ± 105.0 (SD) Mg ha−1] versus Palaeotropical forests (Africa 418.3 ± 91.8 Mg ha−1; Asia 393.3 ± 109.3 Mg ha−1). Pan-tropical variation in density of large trees and AGB was associated with soil coarseness (negative), soil fertility (positive), community wood density (positive) and dominance of wind dispersed species (positive), temperature in the coldest month (negative), temperature in the warmest month (negative) and rainfall in the wettest month (positive), but results were not always consistent among continents. Main conclusions Density of large trees and AGB were significantly associated with climatic variables, indicating that climate change will affect tropical forest biomass storage. Species trait composition will interact with these future biomass changes as they are also affected by a warmer climate. Given the importance of large trees for variation in AGB across the tropics, and their sensitivity to climate change, we emphasize the need for in-depth analyses of the community dynamics of large trees.},

We review the current understanding of temperature effects on the ecophysiology of tropical trees from organelle to biome level, where we distinguish between short-term responses, acclimation, and adaptation. We present new data on short-term temperature responses of photosynthesis and dark respiration, and temperature acclimation of photosynthesis. We also compare new field and laboratory-obtained photosynthesis-temperature response data. We identify several priority study areas. (1) Acclimation: We need to better understand photosynthetic acclimation, for example to determine whether the adjustment of the thermal optimum of photosynthesis (TOpt) is consistently negated by a decrease in photosynthesis at TOpt, as we observed. (2) Growth: Whereas tropical seedlings may grow better with warming, canopy trees reportedly grow worse; we do not currently know what explains these contrasting temperature effects. (3) Reproduction: Tropical trees may be close to reproductive temperature thresholds, as heat sterility in crops occurs in the upper 30 °C range. Nonetheless, the temperature sensitivity of tropical tree reproduction is virtually unstudied. (4) Mortality: How does heat-induced atmospheric drought (high leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit) affect tropical tree mortality? (5) Stomatal behavior: What is the specific role of temperature in the induction of midday-stomtal closure on sunny days? Better knowledge in these areas will improve our ability to predict carbon fluxes in tropical forests experiencing ongoing warming.},

  abstract = {Respiration is instrumental for survival and growth of plants, but increasing costs of maintenance processes with warming have the potential to change the balance between photosynthetic carbon uptake and respiratory carbon release from leaves. Climate warming may cause substantial increases of leaf respiratory carbon fluxes, which would further impact the carbon balance of terrestrial vegetation. However, downregulation of respiratory physiology via thermal acclimation may mitigate this impact. We have conducted a meta-analysis with data collected from 43 independent studies to assess quantitatively the thermal acclimation capacity of leaf dark respiration to warming of terrestrial plant species from across the globe. In total, 282 temperature contrasts were included in the meta-analysis, representing 103 species of forbs, graminoids, shrubs, trees and lianas native to arctic, boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems. Acclimation to warming was found to decrease respiration at a set temperature in the majority of the observations, regardless of the biome of origin and growth form, but respiration was not completely homeostatic across temperatures in the majority of cases. Leaves that developed at a new temperature had a greater capacity for acclimation than those transferred to a new temperature. We conclude that leaf respiration of most terrestrial plants can acclimate to gradual warming, potentially reducing the magnitude of the positive feedback between climate and the carbon cycle in a warming world. More empirical data are, however, needed to improve our understanding of interspecific variation in thermal acclimation capacity, and to better predict patterns in respiratory carbon fluxes both within and across biomes in the face of ongoing global warming.},

  abstract = {Exceeding thermal thresholds causes irreversible damage and ultimately loss of leaves. The lowland tropics are among the warmest forested biomes, but little is known about heat tolerance of tropical forest species. We surveyed leaf heat tolerance of sun-exposed leaves from 147 tropical lowland and pre-montane forest species by determining the temperatures at which potential photosystem II efficiency based on chlorophyll a fluorescence started to decrease (TCrit) and had decreased by 50\% (T50). TCrit averaged 46.7°C (5th–95th percentile: 43.5–49.7°C) and T50 averaged 49.9°C (47.8–52.5°C). Heat tolerance partially adjusted to site temperature; TCrit and T50 decreased with elevation by 0.40°C and 0.26°C per 100m, respectively, while mean annual temperature decreased by 0.63°C per 100m. The phylogenetic signal in heat tolerance was weak, suggesting that heat tolerance is more strongly controlled by environment than by evolutionary legacies. TCrit increased with the estimated thermal time constant of the leaves, indicating that species with thermally buffered leaves maintain higher heat tolerance. Among lowland species, T50 increased with leaf mass per area, so species with structurally more costly leaves reduce the risk of leaf loss during hot spells. These results provide insight in interspecific variation in heat tolerance at local and regional scales.},

  abstract = {Exceeding thermal thresholds causes irreversible damage and ultimately loss of leaves. The lowland tropics are among the warmest forested biomes, but little is known about heat tolerance of tropical forest plants. We surveyed leaf heat tolerance of sun-exposed leaves from 147 tropical lowland and pre-montane forest species by determining the temperatures at which potential photosystem II efficiency based on chlorophyll a fluorescence started to decrease (TCrit) and had decreased by 50\% (T50). TCrit averaged 46.7 C (5th–95th percentile: 43.5 C–49.7 C) and T50 averaged 49.9 C (47.8 C–52.5 C). Heat tolerance partially adjusted to site temperature; TCrit and T50 decreased with elevation by 0.40 C and 0.26 C per 100 m, respectively, while mean annual temperature decreased by 0.63 C per 100 m. The phylogenetic signal in heat tolerance was weak, suggesting that heat tolerance is more strongly controlled by environment than by evolutionary legacies. TCrit increased with the estimated thermal time constant of the leaves, indicating that species with thermally buffered leaves maintain higher heat tolerance. Among lowland species, T50 increased with leaf mass per area, suggesting that in species with structurally more costly leaves the risk of leaf loss during hot spells is reduced. These results provide insight in variation in heat tolerance at local and regional scales.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of heat tolerance of tropical trees have focused on canopy leaves exposed to full sunlight and high temperatures. However, in lowland tropical forests with leaf area indices of 5–6, the vast majority of leaves experience varying degrees of shade and a reduced heat load compared to sun leaves. Here we tested whether heat tolerance is lower in shade than in sun leaves. For three tropical tree species, Calophyllum inophyllum, Inga spectabilis, and Ormosia macrocalyx, disks of fully developed shade and sun leaves were subjected to 15-min heat treatments, followed by measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence after 48 h of recovery. In two of the three species, the temperature causing a 50\% decrease of the fluorescence ratio Fv/Fm (T50) was significantly lower (by \textasciitilde\,1.0 °C) in shade than in sun leaves, indicating a moderately decreased heat tolerance of shade leaves. In shade leaves of these two species, the rise in initial fluorescence, F0, also occurred at lower temperatures. In the third species, there was no shade-sun difference in T50. In situ measurements of photosynthetic C­ O2 assimilation showed that the optimum temperature for photosynthesis tended to be lower in shade leaves, although differences were not significant. At supra-optimal temperatures, photosynthesis was largely constrained by stomatal conductance, and the high-temperature C­ O2 compensation point, TMax, occurred at considerably lower temperatures than T50. Our study demonstrates that the temperature response of shade leaves of tropical trees differs only marginally from that of sun leaves, both in terms of heat tolerance and photosynthetic performance.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric and climate change will expose tropical forests to conditions they have not experienced in millions of years. To better understand the consequences of this change we studied photosynthetic acclimation of the neotropical tree species Tabebuia rosea to combined 4°C warming and twice-ambient (800 ppm) CO2. We measured temperature responses of the maximum rates of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation (VCMax), photosynthetic electron transport (JMax), net photosynthesis (PNet), and stomatal conductance (gs), and fitted the data using a probabilistic Bayesian approach. To evaluate short-term acclimation plants were then switched between treatment and control conditions and re-measured after 1–2 weeks. Consistent with acclimation, the optimum temperatures (TOpt) for VCMax, JMax and PNet were 1–5°C higher in treatment than in control plants, while photosynthetic capacity (VCMax, JMax, and PNet at TOpt) was 8–25\% lower. Likewise, moving control plants to treatment conditions moderately increased temperature optima and decreased photosynthetic capacity. Stomatal density and sensitivity to leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit were not affected by growth conditions, and treatment plants did not exhibit stronger stomatal limitations. Collectively, these results illustrate the strong photosynthetic plasticity of this tropical tree species as even fully-developed leaves of saplings transferred to extreme conditions partially acclimated.},

We determined in situ photosynthetic temperature–response curves for upper canopy leaves of 42 tree and liana species from two tropical forests in Panama with contrasting rainfall regimes. On the basis of seedling studies, we hypothesized that species with high photosynthetic capacity – light-demanding, fast-growing species – would have a higher temperature optimum of photosynthesis (TOpt) than species with low photosynthetic capacity – shade-tolerant, slow-growing species – and that, therefore, TOpt would scale with the position of a species on the slow–fast continuum of plant functional traits. TOpt was remarkably similar across species, regardless of their photosynthetic capacity and other plant functional traits. Community-average TOpt was almost identical to mean maximum daytime temperature, which was higher in the dry forest. Photosynthesis above TOpt appeared to be more strongly limited by stomatal conductance in the dry forest than in the wet forest. The observation that all species in a community shared similar TOpt values suggests that photosynthetic performance is optimized under current temperature regimes. These results should facilitate the scaling up of photosynthesis in relation to temperature from leaf to stand level in species-rich tropical forests.},

We measured temperature response curves of R on 123 upper-canopy leaves of 28 species of trees and lianas from a tropical forest in Panama and analysed variations in R and Q10 in relation to other leaf functional traits. Respiration rates per leaf area at 25 °C (RA) varied widely among species and were significantly higher in trees than in lianas. RA was best predicted by a multiple regression model containing leaf phosphorus concentration, photosynthetic capacity and leaf mass per area (r2 = 0·64). The mean Q10 value (2·4) was significantly higher than the commonly assumed value of 2·0. Q10 was best predicted by the combination of leaf carbohydrate concentration and growth form (trees vs lianas) (r2 = 0·26). The night-time leaf respiratory carbon flux from this tropical forest was calculated from these multiple regression models to be 4·5 Mg C ha−1 year−1, with an estimated additional 2·9 Mg C ha−1 year−1 being released by respiration during the day. Trait-based modelling has potential for estimating R, thus facilitating carbon flux estimation in species-rich tropical forests. However, in contrast to global analyses, leaf phosphorus content was the most important correlate of R and not leaf nitrogen, so calibration of trait models to the tropics will be important. Leaf traits are poor predictors of Q10 values, and more empirical data on the temperature sensitivity of respiration are critically needed to further improve our ability to scale temperature-dependent respiration in species-rich tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests may be vulnerable to climate change1–3 if photosynthetic carbon uptake currently operates near a high temperature limit4–6. Predicting tropical forest function requires understanding the relative contributions of two mechanisms of high-temperature photosynthetic declines: stomatal limitation (H1), an indirect response due to temperature-associated changes in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD)7, and biochemical restrictions (H2), a direct temperature response8,9. Their relative control predicts different outcomes—H1 is expected to diminish with stomatal responses to future co-occurring elevated atmospheric [CO2], whereas H2 portends declining photosynthesis with increasing temperatures. Distinguishing the two mechanisms at high temperatures is therefore critical, but difficult because VPD is highly correlated with temperature in natural settings. We used a forest mesocosm to quantify the sensitivity of tropical gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) to future temperature regimes while constraining VPD by controlling humidity. We then analytically decoupled temperature and VPD effects under current climate with flux-tower-derived GEP trends in situ from four tropical forest sites. Both approaches showed consistent, negative sensitivity of GEP to VPD but little direct response to temperature. Importantly, in the mesocosm at low VPD, GEP persisted up to 38\,°C, a temperature exceeding projections for tropical forests in 2100 (ref. 10). If elevated [CO2] mitigates VPD-induced stomatal limitation through enhanced water-use efficiency as hypothesized9,11, tropical forest photosynthesis may have a margin of resilience to future warming.},

  abstract = {Leaf canopy carbon exchange processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, are substantial components of the global carbon cycle. Climate models base their simulations of photosynthesis and respiration on an empirical understanding of the underlying biochemical processes, and the responses of those processes to environmental drivers. As such, data spanning large spatial scales are needed to evaluate and parameterize these models. Here, we present data on four important biochemical parameters defining leaf carbon exchange processes from 626 individuals of 98 species at 12 North and Central American sites spanning 53° of latitude. The four parameters are the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (Vcmax), the maximum rate of electron transport for the regeneration of Ribulose-1,5,-bisphosphate (Jmax), the maximum rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase carboxylation (Vpmax), and leaf dark respiration (Rd). The raw net photosynthesis by intercellular CO2 (A/Ci) data used to calculate Vcmax, Jmax, and Vpmax rates are also presented. Data were gathered on the same leaf of each individual (one leaf per individual), allowing for the examination of each parameter relative to others. Additionally, the data set contains a number of covariates for the plants measured. Covariate data include (1) leaf-level traits (leaf mass, leaf area, leaf nitrogen and carbon content, predawn leaf water potential), (2) plant-level traits (plant height for herbaceous individuals and diameter at breast height for trees), (3) soil moisture at the time of measurement, (4) air temperature from nearby weather stations for the day of measurement and each of the 90 d prior to measurement, and (5) climate data (growing season mean temperature, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and aridity index). We hope that the data will be useful for obtaining greater understanding of the abiotic and biotic determinants of these important biochemical parameters and for evaluating and improving large-scale models of leaf carbon exchange.},

However, until recently, fine-scale observations critical to revealing ecological mechanisms underlying these changes have been lacking. To investigate fine-scale variation in leaf area with seasonality and drought we conducted monthly ground-based LiDAR surveys over 4 yr at an Amazon forest site. We analysed temporal changes in vertically structured LAI along axes of both canopy height and light environments. Upper canopy LAI increased during the dry season, whereas lower canopy LAI decreased. The low canopy decrease was driven by highly illuminated leaves of smaller trees in gaps. By contrast, understory LAI increased concurrently with the upper canopy. Hence, tree phenological strategies were stratified by height and light environments. Trends were amplified during a 2015–2016 severe El Niño drought. Leaf area low in the canopy exhibited behaviour consistent with water limitation. Leaf loss from short trees in high light during drought may be associated with strategies to tolerate limited access to deep soil water and stressful leaf environments. Vertically and environmentally structured phenological processes suggest a critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in seasonal changes in Amazon ecosystem function.},

Here we evaluate variation in metamer traits (i.e., traits associated with internodes, petioles and their corresponding leaves) and parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence within and among populations of a neotropical tree, Copaifera langsdorffii. We also evaluated phenotypic plasticity in natural settings comparing traits between shade and sun-exposed metamers. We selected six populations along a climatic gradient ranging from semi-arid to humid and representing three different biomes (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest). Local climatic conditions significantly affected the morphological and physiological traits of populations. Trait variation among populations was explained mainly by aridity index and evapotranspiration. Individuals from drier regions had lower specific leaf area (SLA), lower investment in leaf area per total dry mass of metamer (LARm), lower specific petiole length (SPL) and lower potential quantum yield (Fv/Fm, only for sun-exposed metamers). Populations from locations with greater environmental heterogeneity (interannual variation) had greater plasticity in response to light for Fv/Fm and electron transport rate (ETR) and morphological traits related to the hydraulic and biomechanical aspects of the leaves (petiole length, internode length and SPL). High intraspecific variation in metamer traits in C. langsdorffii coupled with its ability to modify these traits in response to different climate conditions can explain the success of the species over a range of different habitats and represent important factors for the persistence of this species in the face of climate change.},

  abstract = {The response of forests to climate change depends in part on whether the photosynthetic benefit from increased atmospheric CO2 (∆Ca = future minus historic CO2) compensates for increased physiological stresses from higher temperature (∆T). We predicted the outcome of these competing responses by using optimization theory and a mechanistic model of tree water transport and photosynthesis. We simulated current and future productivity, stress, and mortality in mature monospecific stands with soil, species, and climate sampled from 20 continental US locations. We modeled stands with and without acclimation to ∆Ca and ∆T, where acclimated forests adjusted leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and stand density to maximize productivity while avoiding stress. Without acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in net primary productivity (NPP) was compromised by ∆T-driven stress and mortality associated with vascular failure. With acclimation, the ∆Ca-driven boost in NPP and stand biomass (C storage) was accentuated for cooler futures but negated for warmer futures by a ∆T-driven reduction in NPP and biomass. Thus, hotter futures reduced forest biomass through either mortality or acclimation. Forest outcomes depended on whether projected climatic ∆Ca/∆T ratios were above or below physiological thresholds that neutralized the negative impacts of warming. Critically, if forests do not acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must be above ca. 89 ppm⋅°C−1 to avoid chronic stress, a threshold met by 55\% of climate projections. If forests do acclimate, the ∆Ca/∆T must rise above ca. 67 ppm⋅°C−1 for NPP and biomass to increase, a lower threshold met by 71\% of projections.},

  abstract = {Most trees in northern-temperate or boreal forests are either needle-leaved and evergreen or broad-leaved and deciduous. Needle-leaved deciduous trees or broad-leaved evergreens exist but are much less common. It is suggested that evergreenness and needle leaves go together because small, needle-shaped leaves can readily be displayed in a pattern that disperses the incoming light over a larger number of leaves, which increases total photosynthesis by reducing the energy wastage that occurs when light energy falls on leaves that are already light-saturated. This strategy is most effective for trees that retain their leaves for several years and develop a deep canopy with many layers of leaves, in which light passing through the first few layers is captured by leaves deeper in the canopy. Since low temperatures reduce photosynthesis more in light-saturated leaves than in unsaturated leaves, mechanisms that minimize saturation are especially important for trees that may carry out substantial photosynthesis at low temperatures. For deciduous trees, however, broad leaves displayed more or less perpendicular to the sun are more advantageous, since they intercept more light with fewer layers of leaves, reducing the biomass of leaves that needs to be produced each year.},

  abstract = {We evaluate local differences in thermal regimes and turbulent heat fluxes across the heterogeneous canopy of a black spruce boreal forest on discontinuous permafrost in interior Alaska. The data were taken during an intensive observing period in the summer of 2013 from two micrometeorological towers 600 m apart in a central section of boreal forest, one in a denser canopy (DC) and the other in a sparser canopy, but under approximately similar atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow conditions. Results suggest that on average 34\% of the half-hourly periods in a day are nonstationary, primarily during night and during ABL transitions. Also, thermal regimes differ between the two towers; specifically between midnight and 0500 Alaska Standard Time (AKST) it is about 3°C warmer at DC. On average, the sensible heat flux at DC was greater. For midday periods, the difference between those fluxes exceeded 30\% of the measured flux and over 30 W m−2 in magnitude more than 60\% of the time. These differences are due to higher mechanical mixing as a result of the increased density of roughness elements at DC. Finally, the vertical distribution of turbulent heat fluxes verifies a maximum atop the canopy crown (2.6 h) when compared with the subcanopy (0.6 h) and above canopy (5.1 h), where h is the mean canopy height. We argue that these spatial and vertical variations of sensible heat fluxes result from the complex scale aggregation of energy fluxes over a heterogeneous canopy.},

  abstract = {Tropical ecosystems are undergoing unprecedented rates of degradation from deforestation, fire, and drought disturbances. The collective effects of these disturbances threaten to shift large portions of tropical ecosystems such as Amazon forests into savanna-like structure via tree loss, functional changes, and the emergence of fire (savannization). Changes from forest states to a more open savanna-like structure can affect local microclimates, surface energy fluxes, and biosphere–atmosphere interactions. A predominant type of ecosystem state change is the loss of tree cover and structural complexity in disturbed forest. Although important advances have been made contrasting energy fluxes between historically distinct old-growth forest and savanna systems, the emergence of secondary forests and savanna-like ecosystems necessitates a reframing to consider gradients of tree structure that span forest to savanna-like states at multiple scales. In this Innovative Viewpoint, we draw from the literature on forest–grassland continua to develop a framework to assess the consequences of tropical forest degradation on surface energy fluxes and canopy structure. We illustrate this framework for forest sites with contrasting canopy structure that ranges from simple, open, and savanna-like to complex and closed, representative of tropical wet forest, within two climatically distinct regions in the Amazon. Using a recently developed rapid field assessment approach, we quantify differences in cover, leaf area vertical profiles, surface roughness, albedo, and energy balance partitioning between adjacent sites and compare canopy structure with adjacent old-growth forest; more structurally simple forests displayed lower net radiation. To address forest–atmosphere feedback, we also consider the effects of canopy structure change on susceptibility to additional future disturbance. We illustrate a converse transition—recovery in structure following disturbance—measuring forest canopy structure 10 yr after the imposition of a 5-yr drought in the ground-breaking Seca Floresta experiment. Our approach strategically enables rapid characterization of surface properties relevant to vegetation models following degradation, and advances links between surface properties and canopy structure variables, increasingly available from remote sensing. Concluding, we hypothesize that understanding surface energy balance and microclimate change across degraded tropical forest states not only reveals critical atmospheric forcing, but also critical local-scale feedbacks from forest sensitivity to additional climate-linked disturbance.},

  abstract = {1 Monitoring of two canopy species Dicorynia guianensis and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) in a tropical rain forest in French Guiana was used to investigate vegetative crown development at five organizational levels: leaf, metamer, extension unit, sympodial unit and whole crown. The effects of light availability and tree height on different traits were evaluated in trees {$<$} 25 m in height and compared with taller individuals (25–37 m). Path-analysis is used to illustrate the consequences of trait changes at multiple levels of organization for the whole crown level. 2 Tree height and canopy openness influenced crown development at each organizational level. Crowns in higher light levels had lower specific leaf area, greater leaf spacing, greater extension of all branches, and greater extension of the leader shoot. With increasing tree height, crowns had a lower specific leaf area, greater leaf area index and greater relative crown depth. 3 Vouacapoua showed some responses to light not seen in Dicorynia. In particular, Vouacapoua increased meristem activity with light, but the lack of response in Dicorynia may be due to moderate light levels rather than inability to respond. 4 Low leaf-display costs at low light availability may enable trees to survive light suppression. 5 Light availability cannot explain trait changes with tree height. Alternative explanations for trait changes with tree height are discussed. 6 Several of the relationships between plant traits and tree height or canopy openness became non-linear when taller trees (25–37 m) were included. In these taller trees, vegetative growth was reduced at all organizational levels, particularly in Vouacapoua, which does not grow as tall as Dicorynia. 7 Qualitatively, plant responses to light did not differ between trees of different height, and were similar to seedling and sapling data in the literature. Responses were, however, quantitatively different, suggesting that small saplings cannot serve as model organisms for crown development in taller trees.},

  abstract = {Climate change, via warmer springs and autumns, may lengthen the carbon uptake period of boreal tree species, increasing the potential for carbon sequestration in boreal forests, which could help slow climate change. However, if other seasonal cues such as photoperiod dictate when photosynthetic capacity declines, warmer autumn temperatures may have little effect on when carbon uptake capacity decreases in these species. We investigated whether autumn warming would delay photosynthetic decline in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) by growing seedlings under declining weekly photoperiods and weekly temperatures either at ambient temperature or a warming treatment 4\hspace{0.25em}°C above ambient. Photosynthetic capacity was relatively constant in both treatments when weekly temperatures were \&gt;8\hspace{0.25em}°C, but declined rapidly at lower temperatures, leading to a delay in the autumn decline in photosynthetic capacity in the warming treatment. The decline in photosynthetic capacity was not related to changes in leaf nitrogen or chlorophyll concentrations, but was correlated with a decrease in the apparent fraction of leaf nitrogen invested in Rubisco, implicating a shift in nitrogen allocation away from the Calvin cycle at low autumn growing temperatures. Our data suggest that as the climate warms, the period of net carbon uptake will be extended in the autumn for boreal forests dominated by Norway spruce, which could increase total carbon uptake in these forests.},

The field study was further intended to provide data to develop and test models of forest canopy effects on beneath-canopy snowpack accumulation and melt and the plot and stand scales. Weighing lysimeters, cut-tree experiments, and manual snow surveys were deployed at a site in the Umpqua National Forest, Oregon (elevation 1200 m). A unique design for a weighing lysimeter was employed that allowed continuous measurements of snowpack evolution beneath a forest canopy to be taken at a scale unaffected by variability in canopy throughfall. Continuous observations of snowpack evolution in large clearings were made coincidentally with the canopy measurements. Large differences in snow accumulation and ablation were observed at sites beneath the forest canopy and in large clearings. These differences were not well described by simple relationships between the sites. Over the study period, approximately 60\% of snowfall was intercepted by the canopy (up to a maximum of about 40 mm water equivalent). Instantaneous sublimation rates exceeded 0.5 mm per hour for short periods. However, apparent average sublimation from the intercepted snow was less than 1 mm per day and totaled approximately 100 mm per winter season. Approximately 72 and 28\% of the remaining intercepted snow was removed as meltwater drip and large snow masses, respectively. Observed differences in snow interception rate and maximum snow interception capacity between Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) were minimal.},

  abstract = {Protecting biodiversity against the impacts of climate change requires effective conservation strategies that safeguard species at risk of extinction¹. Microrefugia allowed populations to survive adverse climatic conditions in the past2,3, but their potential to reduce extinction risk from anthropogenic warming is poorly understood3–5, hindering our capacity to develop robust in situ measures to adapt conservation to climate change⁶. Here, we show that microclimatic heterogeneity has strongly buffered species against regional extirpations linked to recent climate change. Using more than five million distribution records for 430 climate-threatened and range-declining species, population losses across England are found to be reduced in areas where topography generated greater variation in the microclimate. The buffering effect of topographic microclimates was strongest for those species adversely affected by warming and in areas that experienced the highest levels of warming: in such conditions, extirpation risk was reduced by 22\% for plants and by 9\% for insects. Our results indicate the critical role of topographic variation in creating microrefugia, and provide empirical evidence that microclimatic heterogeneity can substantially reduce extinction risk from climate change.},

  abstract = {Thermal sensitivity of tropical trees A key uncertainty in climate change models is the thermal sensitivity of tropical forests and how this value might influence carbon fluxes. Sullivan et al. measured carbon stocks and fluxes in permanent forest plots distributed globally. This synthesis of plot networks across climatic and biogeographic gradients shows that forest thermal sensitivity is dominated by high daytime temperatures. This extreme condition depresses growth rates and shortens the time that carbon resides in the ecosystem by killing trees under hot, dry conditions. The effect of temperature is worse above 32°C, and a greater magnitude of climate change thus risks greater loss of tropical forest carbon stocks. Nevertheless, forest carbon stocks are likely to remain higher under moderate climate change if they are protected from direct impacts such as clearance, logging, or fires. Science, this issue p. 869 The sensitivity of tropical forest carbon to climate is a key uncertainty in predicting global climate change. Although short-term drying and warming are known to affect forests, it is unknown if such effects translate into long-term responses. Here, we analyze 590 permanent plots measured across the tropics to derive the equilibrium climate controls on forest carbon. Maximum temperature is the most important predictor of aboveground biomass (−9.1 megagrams of carbon per hectare per degree Celsius), primarily by reducing woody productivity, and has a greater impact per °C in the hottest forests ({$>$}32.2°C). Our results nevertheless reveal greater thermal resilience than observations of short-term variation imply. To realize the long-term climate adaptation potential of tropical forests requires both protecting them and stabilizing Earth’s climate. Biome-wide variation in tropical forest carbon stocks and dynamics shows long-term resilience to increasing high temperatures.

  abstract = {Experimental research shows that isoprene emission by plants can improve photosynthetic performance at high temperatures. But whether species that emit isoprene have higher thermal limits than non‐emitting species remains largely untested. Tropical plants are adapted to narrow temperature ranges and global warming could result in significant ecosystem restructuring due to small variations in species' thermal tolerances. We compared photosynthetic temperature responses of 26 co‐occurring tropical tree and liana species to test whether isoprene‐emitting species are more tolerant to high temperatures. We classified species as isoprene emitters versus non‐emitters based on published datasets. Maximum temperatures for net photosynthesis were \textasciitilde 1.8°C higher for isoprene‐emitting species than for non‐emitters, and thermal response curves were 24\% wider; differences in optimum temperatures (Topt) or photosynthetic rates at Topt were not significant. Modelling the carbon cost of isoprene emission, we show that even strong emission rates cause little reduction in the net carbon assimilation advantage over non‐emitters at supraoptimal temperatures. Isoprene emissions may alleviate biochemical limitations, which together with stomatal conductance, co‐limit photosynthesis above Topt. Our findings provide evidence that isoprene emission may be an adaptation to warmer thermal niches, and that emitting species may fare better under global warming than co‐occurring non‐emitting species.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Both plant physiology and atmospheric chemistry are substantially altered by the emission of volatile isoprenoids (VI), such as isoprene and monoterpenes, from plant leaves. Yet, since gaining scientific attention in the 1950’s, empirical research on leaf VI has been largely confined to laboratory experiments and atmospheric observations. Here, we introduce a new field instrument designed to bridge the scales from leaf to atmosphere, by enabling precision VI detection in real time from plants in their natural ecological setting. With a field campaign in the Brazilian Amazon, we reveal an unexpected distribution of leaf emission capacities (EC) across the vertical axis of the forest canopy, with EC peaking in the mid-canopy instead of the sun-exposed canopy surface, and high emissions occurring in understory specialist species. Compared to the simple interpretation that VI protect leaves from heat stress at the hot canopy surface, our results encourage a more nuanced view of the adaptive role of VI in plants. We infer that forest emissions to the atmosphere depend on the dynamic microenvironments imposed by canopy structure, and not simply on canopy surface conditions. We provide a new emissions inventory from 51 tropical tree species, revealing moderate consistency in EC within taxonomic groups. Our self-contained, portable instrument provides real-time detection and live measurement feedback with precision and detection limits better than 0.5 nmol m\textsuperscript{-2}\textsubscript{leaf} s\textsuperscript{-1}. We call the instrument ‘PORCO’ based on the gas detection method: photoionization of organic compounds. We provide a thorough validation of PORCO and demonstrate its capacity to detect ecologically driven variation in leaf emission rates and thus accelerate a nascent field of science: the ecology and ecophysiology of plant volatiles.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Type of paper{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Method{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The subject of this paper, sun leaves are thicker and show higher photosynthetic rates than the shade leaves, is approached in two ways. The first seeks to answer the question: why are sun leaves thicker than shade leaves? To do this, CO2 diffusion within a leaf is examined first. Because affinity of Rubisco for CO2 is low, the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is competitively inhibited by O2, and the oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate leads to energy-consuming photorespiration, it is essential for C3 plants to maintain the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast as high as possible. Since the internal conductance for CO2 diffusion from the intercellular space to the chloroplast stroma is finite and relatively small, C3 leaves should have sufficient mesophyll surfaces occupied by chloroplasts to secure the area for CO2 dissolution and transport. This explains why sun leaves are thicker. The second approach is mechanistic or ‘how-oriented’. Mechanisms are discussed as to how sun leaves become thicker than shade leaves, in particular, the long-distance signal transduction from mature leaves to leaf primordia inducing the periclinal division of the palisade tissue cells. To increase the mesophyll surface area, the leaf can either be thicker or have smaller cells. Issues of cell size are discussed to understand plasticity in leaf thickness.},

  abstract = {Forests are widely observed to contain two or more discrete superimposed strata of plants. In the eastern United States, deciduous forests growing between 30⚬ and 42⚬ north latitude are commonly constructed of three strata: a high canopy of sun-adapted trees, a shade-tolerant herbaceous ground layer, and a midstory of shrubs or small trees, of which the flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a prime example. Flowering dogwoods and other woody species occupying ecologically equivalent positions in the forest midstory must depend heavily on sunflecks because up to 80\% of the light penetrating the forest interior is this kind of direct-beam illumination. The light field in the forest interior is simply modeled. Immediately beneath the canopy, the light field (integrated over the daily sun cycle) is characterized by a high horizontal variance, because any point is either in a gap and directly illuminated or under a crown and continuously shaded. Farther down in the forest interior the horizontal variance becomes greatly diminished because the expanding cones of light beneath each gap eventually intersect. Where the cones of light from alternate gaps intersect, the light field becomes horizontally uniform. Plants of the woody middle stratum should grow up to, but not exceed, the upper limit of the horizontally uniform light field. The position of the upper limit of the horizontally uniform light field can be predicted from measurements of the canopy and the angular distribution of light gaps overhead. Such predictions for five climax stands in the southeastern United States agreed quite closely with the median height of trees composing the midstory of these stands. Finally, the shapes of tree crowns can be expected to vary adaptively with the systematic latitudinal decrease in the angle of the sun above the horizon. Consequently, tree crowns at high latitudes are narrowly conical in profile, but those in tropical latitudes tend to be planar or shallowly dome-shaped. As a result, direct light is admitted to high-latitude forests only at sharply inclined angles that do not permit the establishment of a woody midstory. By contrast, light is able to penetrate the canopy of tropical forests at relatively shallow angles, allowing the development of a second tree layer closely beneath the crowns of the first. The vertical dimension of plant species diversity thus seems to be controlled by adaptive responses to physical parameters of the latitudinal gradient.},

It is projected that the global land area experiencing heat waves will double by 2020, and quadruple by 2040. Extreme heat events can impact a wide variety of tree functions. At the leaf level, photosynthesis is reduced, photooxidative stress increases, leaves abscise and the growth rate of remaining leaves decreases. In some species, stomatal conductance increases at high temperatures, which may be a mechanism for leaf cooling. At the whole plant level, heat stress can decrease growth and shift biomass allocation. When drought stress accompanies heat waves, the negative effects of heat stress are exacerbated and can lead to tree mortality. However, some species exhibit remarkable tolerance to thermal stress. Responses include changes that minimize stress on photosynthesis and reductions in dark respiration. Although there have been few studies to date, there is evidence of within-species genetic variation in thermal tolerance, which could be important to exploit in production forestry systems. Understanding the mechanisms of differing tree responses to extreme temperature events may be critically important for understanding how tree species will be affected by climate change.},

  abstract = {More frequent and severe disturbances increasingly open the forest canopy and initiate tree regeneration. Simultaneously, increasing weather extremes, such as drought and heat, are threatening species adapted to cool and moist climate. The magnitude of the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies to mitigate hot and dry weather conditions and its disturbance-induced reduction remains poorly quantified. Also, the influence of disturbance legacies (e.g., deadwood) on forest microclimate is unresolved. In a unique manipulation experiment we investigated (i) the microclimatic buffering capacity of forest canopies in years with different climatic conditions; (ii) the impacts of spatial disturbance patterns on surface light and microclimate; and (iii) the effect of deadwood presence and type on microclimate. Treatments included two disturbance patterns (i.e., aggregated and distributed), four deadwood types (i.e., standing, downed, standing and downed, removed), and one untreated control (i.e., nine treatments in total), replicated at five sites dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in southeastern Germany. We measured forest floor light conditions and derived diurnal extremes and variation in temperature (T) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during four consecutive summer seasons (2016 – 2019). The buffering capacity of intact forest canopies was higher in warm and dry years. Surface light was significantly higher in spatially aggregated disturbance gaps compared to distributed disturbances of similar severity. An increase in surface light by 10 \% relative to closed canopies elevated Tmax and VPDmax by 0.42°C and 0.04 kPa, respectively. Deadwood presence and type did not affect the forest microclimate significantly. Microclimatic buffering under forest canopies can dampen the effects of climate change. However, increasing canopy disturbances result in more light penetrating the canopy, reducing the microclimatic buffering capacity of forests. We conclude that forest management should foster microclimatic buffering in forests as one element of a multi-pronged strategy to counter climate change.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of the tallest trees in tropical forests are of special interest due to their carbon content, canopy dominance, and the large canopy gaps created when they die. Known ecological mechanisms that may influence tall tree survival lead to conflicting predictions. Hydraulic stress and exposure to high winds and desiccation should increase death rates, yet the tallest trees have the greatest access to light and escape damage caused by falling boles and branches. The uncertainty in tall tree mortality rates has been difficult to address due to their low density, which makes mortality rates challenging to estimate accurately. Here, we use a combination of LiDAR remote sensing and field measurements to show that the mortality rate over 8.5 years among individuals {$>$}40 m tall in 444 ha of lowland Neotropical rain forest was 1.2\% per year, less than half the landscape-scale average for all canopy trees (2.7\% per year). The low mortality is likely explained by species-specific traits that decrease the mortality risk and/or ecological advantages of height that outweigh the risks. Regardless of the mechanisms, the low mortality rate has important implications for tropical forest carbon budgets, as we estimated that a single tall individual represents 2–11\% of total live aboveground carbon stocks per hectare. Our findings suggest that height-specific dynamics may be surprisingly different from traditional diameter-specific dynamics, emphasizing the importance of extending ecological studies to investigate the role of tree height in forest dynamics.},

We resolved the sequences of relative water content and leaf water potential Ψleaf thresholds of functional impairment. On average, losses of leaf rehydration capacity occurred at dehydration beyond 50\% declines of gs, Kleaf and turgor loss point. Losses of Fv/Fm occurred after much stronger dehydration and were not recovered with leaf rehydration. Across species, tissue dehydration thresholds were intercorrelated, suggesting trait co-selection. Thresholds for each type of functional decline were much less variable across species in terms of relative water content than Ψleaf. The stomatal and leaf hydraulic systems show early functional declines before cell integrity is lost. Substantial damage to the photochemical apparatus occurs at extreme dehydration, after complete stomatal closure, and seems to be irreversible.},

  abstract = {We measured the response of dark respiration (Rd) to temperature and foliage characteristics in the upper canopies of tree species in temperate rainforest communites in New Zealand along a soil chronosequence (six sites from 6~years to 120,000~years). The chronosequence provided a vegetation gradient characterised by significant changes in soil nutrition. This enabled us to examine the extent to which changes in dark respiration can be applied across forest biomes and the utility of scaling rules in whole-canopy carbon modelling. The response of respiration to temperature in the dominant tree species differed significantly between sites along the sequence. This involved changes in both Rd at a reference temperature (R10) and the extent to which Rd increased with temperature (described by Eo, a parameter related to the energy of activation, or the change in Rd over a 10°C range, Q10). Site averaged Eo ranged from 44.4~kJ~mol−1~K−1 at the 60-year-old site to 26.0~kJ~mol−1~K−1 at the oldest, most nutrient poor, site. Relationships between respiratory and foliage characteristics indicated that both the temperature response of respiration (Eo or Q10) and the instantaneous rate of respiration increased with both foliar nitrogen and phosphorus content. The ratio of photosynthetic capacity (Whitehead et al. in Oecologia 2005) to respiration (Amax/Rd) attained values in excess of 15 for species in the 6- to 120-year-old sites, but thereafter decreased significantly to around five at the 120,000-year-old site. This indicates that shoot carbon acquisition is regulated by nutrient limitations in the retrogressing ecosystems on the oldest sites. Our findings indicate that respiration and its temperature response will vary according to soil age and, therefore, to soil nutrient availability and the stage of forest development. Thus, variability in respiratory characteristics for canopies should be considered when using models to integrate respiration at large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {1 The responses of night-time dark respiration (Rd) to temperature and leaf characteristics were measured through the canopies of tree species from two distinct forests – an oak-dominated deciduous forest in north-eastern USA, and a conifer-dominated temperate rainforest in New Zealand. These were chosen to examine the extent to which canopy level changes in dark respiration can be applied across forest biomes, and the appropriateness of scaling rules to calculations of whole-canopy carbon efflux. 2 The response of respiration to temperature differed significantly between species and with height in the canopy. This involved changes in both Rd at a reference temperature, and the extent to which Rd increased with temperature (described by the energy of activation, Eo, or the change in Rd over a 10 °C range, Q10). Eo ranged from 25 (lower-canopy leaves) to 53·8 kJ mol−1 K−1 (upper-canopy leaves) in the deciduous forest, and from 24–37 kJ mol−1 K−1 in the temperate rainforest site. 3 Relationships between respiratory and leaf characteristics indicated that the instantaneous rate of respiration covaries with soluble sugar concentration and leaf nitrogen, but the temperature response of respiration (Eo or Q10) appears to be driven by leaf N. 4 Scaling leaf respiratory carbon loss to the whole-canopy level indicated that simplifying assumptions regarding the variation in respiration and its temperature response with canopy height tend to underestimate carbon loss if the assumptions are based on lower-canopy leaf physiology, but overestimate carbon loss if the assumptions are based on upper-canopy physiology. Thus, canopy-level differences in leaf respiratory characteristics should be considered in modelling efforts attempting to estimate whole-canopy respiration.},

In northern high-latitude regions where cold temperatures limit available nitrogen for plants, the photosynthetic parameters are tightly linked with the nitrogen content. Here, we present the leaf- and ecosystem-scale photosynthetic parameters, the maximum carboxylation rate (vcmax25), based on leaf chamber measurements and eddy covariance data from two mature black spruce forests and one young aspen-birth forest in interior Alaska. The leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) explained most of the variations in vcmax25 across the five vascular plants (Picea mariana, Betula glandulosa, Ledum groenlandicum, Betula papyrifera, and Populus tremuloides)(R2 = 0.68; p  {$<$}  0.01), including the overstory and understory, from the three forests. Each plant had a small within-species variability of vcmax25 and leaf C:N, suggesting that plants have a specific potential for available N in photosynthesis. This result indicates that the canopy structure and community composition are presumably important factors for modeling the canopy photosynthesis across boreal forests in interior Alaska. The ecosystem-scale vcmax25 determined from the eddy covariance data further supported this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Although populations are phenotypically diverse, the majority of trait-based studies have focused on examining differences among species. The justification for this broadly applied approach is based on the assumption that differences among species are always greater than within species. This is likely true for local communities, but species are often broadly distributed across a wide range of environments and patterns of intraspecific variation might surpass differences among species. Therefore, an appropriate interpretation of the functional diversity requires an assessment of patterns of trait variation across different ecological scales. In this study, we examine and characterize patterns of leaf trait variation for species that are broadly distributed along an elevational gradient. We focus on seven leaf traits that represent a main axis of functional differentiation in plants reflecting the balance between photosynthetic efficiency, display, and stomatal conductance. We evaluated patterns of trait variance across ecological scales (elevation, species, populations, and individuals) and examined trait covariance at both within species and across species levels, along the elevation gradient. Our results show three key patterns: (1) intraspecific leaf trait variation for broadly distributed species is comparable to the interspecific trait variation, (2) the trait variance structure is highly variable across species, and (3) trait coordination between pairs of leaf traits is evident across species along the gradient, but not always within species. Combined, our results show that trait coordination and covariance are highly idiosyncratic across broadly distributed and co-occurring species, indicating that species may achieve similar functional roles even when exhibiting different phenotypes. This result challenges the traditional paradigm of functional ecology that assumes single trait values as optimal solutions for environments. In conclusion, patterns of trait variation both across and within species should be considered in future studies that assess trade-offs among traits over environmental gradients.},

Experiments were conducted in growth chambers across a leaf temperature range of 19–48°C. Manipulations of temperature were done in well-watered and drought soil conditions and under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) air CO2 concentrations. Increases in leaf temperature caused stomatal opening at both ambient and elevated [CO2]. The gs increased by 42\% in poplar and by 40\% in loblolly pine when leaf temperature increased from 30°C to 40°C at a vapour pressure difference of 1 kPa. Stomatal limitation to photosynthesis decreased in elevated temperature in loblolly pine but not in poplar. The ratio of net photosynthesis to gs depended on leaf temperature, especially at high temperatures. Evaporative cooling of transpiring leaves resulted in reductions in leaf temperature up to 9°C in well-watered poplar but only 1°C in drought-stressed poplar and in loblolly pine. As global mean temperatures rise and temperature extremes become more frequent and severe, understanding the effect of temperature on gs, and modelling that relationship, will become increasingly important.},

Temperate-zone broadleaf and conifer tree species, ranging widely in shade tolerance, were investigated from one locality in the Czech Republic. The study species included strongly shade-tolerant Abies alba Mill. and Tilia cordata Mill., less shade-tolerant Fagus sylvatica L. and Acer pseudoplatanus L. and sun-demanding Picea abies (L.) Karst. In the fully activated photosynthetic state, sun foliage of all species had significantly higher maximum CO(2) assimilation rates, maximum stomatal conductance and maximum rates of carboxylation than shade foliage. Compared with shade leaves, sun leaves had significantly higher nocturnal stomatal conductances. In all species, shade foliage tended to have higher induction states 60 s after leaf illumination than sun foliage. Sun and shade foliage did not differ in the rate of disappearance of the transient biochemical limitation during the induction phase. Longer time periods were required to reach 90\% photosynthetic induction and 90\% stomatal induction in sun foliage than in shade foliage of the less shade-tolerant F. sylvatica and A. pseudoplatanus and in sun-demanding P. abies; however, in sun foliage of the strongly shade-tolerant species T. cordata and A. alba, the time needed for photosynthetic induction was similar to, or less than, that for shade foliage. Shade but not sun needles of P. abies and A. alba had significantly slower induction kinetics than the broadleaf tree species. Among species, the sun-demanding P. abies exhibited the shortest stomatal induction times in both sun and shade leaves. Independently of shade tolerance ranking, the transient stomatal and total limitations that characterize photosynthetic induction were relieved significantly earlier in shade foliage than in sun foliage. Sun foliage generally exhibited a hyperbolic photosynthetic induction response, whereas a sigmoidal induction response was more frequent in shade foliage. The different relative proportions of transient biochemical and stomatal limitations during photosynthetic induction in sun and shade foliage indicate an essential role of stomata in photosynthetic limitation during induction, mainly in shade foliage, with a consequent influence on the shape of the photosynthetic induction curve.},

The optical properties of a leaf are determined by its biochemical and biophysical characteristics, including its 3-D cellular organization. The absorption and scattering properties of leaves together create the shape of their reflectance spectra. Terrestrial seed plant species share similar physiological and metabolic processes for fluxes of gases (CO2, O2, H2O), nutrients, and energy, while differences are primarily consequences of how these properties are distributed and their physical structures. Related species generally share biochemical and biophysical traits, and their optical properties are also similar, providing a mechanism for identification.

  abstract = {Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence techniques were used to evaluate the acclimation capacity of the schlerophyll shrub Heteromeles arbutifolia M. Roem. to the multiple co-occurring summer stresses of the California chaparral. We examined the influence of water, heat and high light stresses on the carbon gain and survival of sun and shade seedlings via a factorial experiment involving a slow drying cycle applied to plants grown outdoors during the summer. The photochemical efficiency of PSII exhibited a diurnal, transient decrease (δF/Fm′) and a chronic decrease or photoinhibition (Fv/Fm) in plants exposed to full sunlight. Water stress enhanced both transient decreases of δF/Fm’and photoinhibition. Effects of decreased δF/Fm’and Fv/Fm on carbon gain were observed only in well-watered plants since in water-stressed plants they were overidden by stomatal closure. Reductions in photochemical efficiency and stomatal conductance were observed in all plants exposed to full sunlight, even in those that were well-watered. This suggested that H. arbutifolia sacrificed carbon gain for water conservation and photoprotection (both structurally via shoot architecture and physiologically via down-regulation) and that this response was triggered by a hot and dry atmosphere together with high PFD, before severe water, heat or high PFD stresses occur. We found fast adaptive adjustments of the thermal stability of PSII (diurnal changes) and a superimposed long-term acclimation (days to weeks) to high leaf temperatures. Water stress enhanced resistance of PSII to high temperatures both in the dark and over a wide range of PFD. Low PFD protected photochemical activity against inactivation by heat while high PFD exacerbated damage of PSII by heat. The greater interception of radiation by horizontally restrained leaves relative to the steep leaves of sun-acclimated plants caused photoinhibition and increased leaf temperature. When transpirational cooling was decreased by water stress, leaf temperature surpassed the limits of chloroplast thermostability. The remarkable acclimation of water-stressed plants to high leaf temperatures proved insufficient for the semi-natural environmental conditions of the experiment. Summer stresses characteristic of Mediterranean-type climates (high leaf temperatures in particular) are a potential limiting factor for seedling survival in H. arbutifolia, especially for shade seedlings lacking the crucial structural photoprotection provided by steep leaf angles.},

The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among cooccurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO₂, climate change and the spread of invasive species.},

  abstract = {Shade, in ecological sense, is not merely a lack of light, but a multi-faceted phenomenon that creates new and complex settings for community and ecosystem dynamics. Tolerating shade therefore affects plants’ ability to cope with other stressors, and also shape its interactions with surrounding organisms. The aim of this broad review was to map our current knowledge about how shade affects plants, plant communities and ecosystems – to gather together knowledge of what we know, but also to point out what we do not yet know. This review covers the following topics: the nature of shade, and ecological and physiological complexities related to growing under a canopy; plants’ capability of tolerating other stress factors while living under a shade – resource trade-offs and polytolerance of abiotic stress; ontogenetic effects of shade tolerance; coexistence patterns under the canopy – how shade determines the forest structure and diversity; shade-induced abiotic dynamics in understorey vegetation, including changing patterns of irradiance, temperature and humidity under the canopy; shade-driven plant–plant and plant–animal interactions – how shade mediates facilitation and stress, and how it creates differentiated environment for different herbivores and pollinators, including the role of volatile organic compounds. We also discuss the ways how vegetation in understorey environments will be affected by climate change, as shade might play a significant role in mitigating negative effects of climate change. Our review shows that living under a shade affects biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of plants, it also influences the outcomes of both symbiotic and competitive plant–plant and plant–animal interactions in a complex and dynamic manner. The current knowledge of shade-related mechanisms is rather ample, however there is much room for progress in integrating different implications of the multifaceted nature of shade into consistent and integral understanding how communities and ecosystems function.},

Here, we present a study of photosynthetic leaf traits (Vcmax and Jmax), foliar dark respiration (Rd), foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and leaf mass per area (LMA) throughout the canopy for five different TMCF species at 3025~m a.s.l. in Andean Peru. All leaf traits showed a significant relationship with canopy height when expressed on an area basis, and Vcmax-area and Jmax-area almost halved when descending through the TMCF canopy. When corrected to a common temperature, average Vcmax and Jmax on a leaf area basis were similar to lowland tropical values, but lower when expressed on a mass basis, because of the higher TMCF LMA values. By contrast, Rd on an area basis was higher than found in tropical lowland forests at a common temperature, and similar to lowland forests on a mass basis. The TMCF Jmax–Vcmax relationship was steeper than in other tropical biomes, and we propose that this can be explained by either the light conditions or the relatively low VPD in the studied TMCF. Furthermore, Vcmax had a significant—though relatively weak and shallow—relationship with N on an area basis, but not with P, which is consistent with the general hypothesis that TMCFs are N rather than P limited. Finally, the observed Vcmax–N relationship (i.e., maximum photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency) was distinctly different from those in tropical and temperate regions, probably because the TMCF leaves compensate for reduced Rubisco activity in cool environments.},

At CL22m, adult beech leaves seemed to be better optimized for photosynthesis than the CL28m leaves because of a large leaf thickness with less protective and impregnated substances, and a higher CCI. The beech saplings, in contrast, did not adapt their stomatal characteristics and leaf anatomy according to the same strategy as the adult beech leaves. Consequently, care is needed when scaling up experimental results from seedlings to adult trees.},

We compared the responses of seedlings of native cold-adapted tropical montane rainforest tree species with those of exotic warm-adapted plantation species, all growing in an intermediate temperature common garden in Rwanda. Leaf gas exchange responses to carbon dioxide (CO2) at different temperatures (20–40°C) were used to assess the temperature responses of biochemical photosynthetic capacities. Analyses revealed a lower optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport rates than for Rubisco carboxylation rates, along with lower electron transport optima in the native cold-adapted than in the exotic warm-adapted species. The photosynthetic optimum temperatures were generally exceeded by daytime peak leaf temperatures, in particular in the native montane rainforest climax species. This study thus provides evidence of pronounced negative effects of high temperature in tropical trees and indicates high susceptibility of montane rainforest climax species to future global warming.},

  abstract = {In temperate climates, seedlings and saplings have often been assumed to be more sensitive to late-spring freezes than conspecific adult trees. Yet, no data are available to compare the freezing resistance of juvenile and adult trees at their phenologically most sensitive stage, that is, during leaf-out. Emerging leaves of seedlings, saplings and adult trees were collected in spring 2013 in seven temperate tree species in a mature mixed forest in the foothills of the Swiss Jura Mountains. Freezing resistance of these emerging leaves was assessed using different target temperatures (−13 to +4 °C) in seven computer-controlled freezers. Additionally, we assessed the risk that species encounter freeze damages based on temperature data recorded since 1898. The different study species showed contrasting freezing resistance, with the LT50 (median lethal freezing temperature) of emerging leaves ranging from −3.5 ± 0.2 °C (Fraxinus excelsior) to −8.3 ± 0.2 °C (Prunus avium). Within species, juvenile trees (seedlings or saplings) were found to be as sensitive to freezing temperatures as mature trees when the same developmental stage of foliage was compared. Based on phenological observations made during spring 2012, long time series of temperatures indicate a very low risk of freeze damage at the study site, especially for adult trees. Synthesis. We conclude that seedlings and saplings are more prone to freeze damage than adult trees because of their earlier flushing rather than due to a higher sensitivity to freezing as such. Our study highlights that the timing of spring phenology has evolved in such a way that it minimizes the risk of freeze damage according to the species-specific LT50. Early flushing species are among the most freezing-resistant species during flushing, whereas late flushing species are among the least resistant. We conclude that for the examined species the species-specific freezing resistance during leaf emergence could be extracted from either adult or juvenile trees, as long as it is estimated at a same phenological stage.},

This study aims to investigate whether this discrepancy results from ontogenic changes or from microclimatic differences. Seedlings of five deciduous tree species were grown in spring 2012 in the understory and at canopy height using a 45-m-high construction crane built into a mature mixed forest in the foothills of the Swiss Jura Mountains. The leaf development of these seedlings, as well as conspecific adults, was compared, taking into account the corresponding microclimate. The date of leaf unfolding occurred 10–40 d earlier in seedlings grown at canopy level than in conspecific adults. Seedlings grown in the understory flushed c. 6 d later than those grown at canopy height, which can be attributed to the warmer temperatures recorded at canopy height (c. 1°C warmer). This study demonstrates that later leaf emergence of canopy trees compared with understory trees results from ontogenic changes and not from the vertical thermal profile that exists within forests. This study warns against the assumption that phenological data obtained in warming and photoperiod experiments on juvenile trees can be used for the prediction of forest response to climate warming.},

  abstract = {Climate change effects on growth rates of tropical trees may lead to alterations in carbon cycling of carbon-rich tropical forests. However, climate sensitivity of broad-leaved lowland tropical trees is poorly understood. Dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) provides a powerful tool to study the relationship between tropical tree growth and annual climate variability. We aimed to establish climate–growth relationships for five annual-ring forming tree species, using ring-width data from 459 canopy and understory trees from a seasonal tropical forest in western Thailand. Based on 183/459 trees, chronologies with total lengths between 29 and 62~years were produced for four out of five species. Bootstrapped correlation analysis revealed that climate–growth responses were similar among these four species. Growth was significantly negatively correlated with current-year maximum and minimum temperatures, and positively correlated with dry-season precipitation levels. Negative correlations between growth and temperature may be attributed to a positive relationship between temperature and autotrophic respiration rates. The positive relationship between growth and dry-season precipitation levels likely reflects the strong water demand during leaf flush. Mixed-effect models yielded results that were consistent across species: a negative effect of current wet-season maximum temperatures on growth, but also additive positive effects of, for example, prior dry-season maximum temperatures. Our analyses showed that annual growth variability in tropical trees is determined by a combination of both temperature and precipitation variability. With rising temperature, the predominantly negative relationship between temperature and growth may imply decreasing growth rates of tropical trees as a result of global warming.},

Even very slight forced-air movements markedly increased heat dissipation in this range of mixed free and forced convection. Lobed plates were more effective dissipators than circles, with the greatest differences occurring where flow was normal to the plate. Circular plates dissipated about one-fourth more heat when vertical than when horizontal in still air (free convection). By contrast, dissipation was essentially independent of orientation for extensively lobed models. Under some circumstances, maximum dissipation occurred with lobed plates oblique to a forced air stream. Physical explanations and biological implications of these results are discussed.},

  abstract = {Forest canopy generally moderates below-canopy air temperature and relative humidity and thus creates a specific microclimate for tree seedling growth. Climate change will alter the moderating capacity, which may render the below-canopy conditions unsuitable for recruitment of the hitherto dominant tree species. We assigned long-term meteorological data (1997–2010) recorded inside and outside of 14 different forest ecosystems in Switzerland to three forest types (broadleaved, non-pine conifer, pine), two altitudinal levels (low, high), the four seasons and general weather situations (normal, hot/dry, cold/wet) to compare moderating capacity of each of these classifiers. Our results confirmed a general moderating effect of canopy on below-canopy microclimate with a decrease of daily maximum air temperature of up to 5.1 ◦C (overall average: 1.8 ◦C) and an increase of daily minimum relative humidity of up to 12.4\% (overall average: 5.1\%) in the long-term average, respectively. Broadleaved and non-pine conifer forests moderated daytime microclimate about twice as much as pine forests, while at nighttime considerably less cooling down and even negative effects on levels of relative humidity compared to the open area were recorded at the pine forest sites. Moderating capacity was stronger at low altitude than at high altitude. It was strongest during the growing season, particularly in summer, and depended in a complex way on the general weather situation. Deviations from the general seasonal and weather condition patterns most likely occurred when soil moisture pools were depleted. Despite the moderating capacity, below-canopy microclimate did not lag behind open area microclimate. Based on our results we conclude that natural recruitment in pine forests and high-altitude forests may respond most sensitively to climate change.},

  abstract = {Leaf size (i.e. leaf surface area and leaf dry mass) profoundly affects a variety of biological carbon, water and energy processes. Therefore, the remarkable variability in individual leaf size and its trade-off with total leaf number in a plant have particularly important implications for understanding the adaption strategy of plants to environmental changes. The various leaf sizes of plants growing in the same habitat are expected to have distinct abilities of thermal regulation influencing leaf water loss and shedding heat. Here, we sampled 16 tree species co-occurring in a temperate forest in northeastern China to quantify the variation of leaf, stomata and twigs traits, and to determine the relationships of leaf size with leaf number and leaf water loss. We examined the right-skewed distributions of leaf size, leafing intensity, stomatal size and stomatal density across species. Leafing intensity was significantly negatively correlated with leaf size, accounting for 4\% and 12\% of variation in leaf area and leaf mass, respectively. Species was the most important factor in explaining the variation in leaf size (conditional R2 of 0.92 for leaf area and 0.82 for leaf mass). Leaf area and mass significantly increased with increasing diameter of twigs. Leaf water loss was strongly negatively correlated with leaf area and leaf mass during the first four hours of the measurement. Leaf area and leaf mass accounted for 38\% and 30\% of variation in total leaf water loss, respectively. Leaf water loss rate (k) was significantly different among tree species and markedly linearly decreased with increasing leaf area and leaf mass for simple-leaved tree species. In conclusion, the existence of a cross-species trade-off between the size of individual leaves and the number of leaves per yearly twig unit was confirmed in that temperate forest. There was strongly negative correlation between leaf water loss and leaf size across tree species, which provides evidences for leaf size in leaf temperature regulation in dry environment with strong radiation. The size-dependent leaf water relation is of central importance to recognize the functional role of leaf size in a changing climate including rapid changes in air temperature and rainfall.},

  abstract = {Aim In response to environmental changes and to avoid extinction, species may either track suitable environmental conditions or adapt to the modified environment. However, whether and how species adapt to environmental changes remains unclear. By focusing on the realized niche (i.e. the actual space that a species inhabits and the resources it can access as a result of limiting biotic factors present in its habitat), we here examine shifts in the realized-niche width (i.e. ecological amplitude) and position (i.e. ecological optimum) of 26 common and widespread forest understorey plants across their distributional ranges. Location Temperate forests along a ca. 1800-km-long latitudinal gradient from northern France to central Sweden and Estonia. Methods We derived species' realized-niche width from a β-diversity metric, which increases if the focal species co-occurs with more species. Based on the concept that species' scores in a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) represent the locations of their realized-niche positions, we developed a novel approach to run species-specific DCAs allowing the focal species to shift its realized-niche position along the studied latitudinal gradient while the realized-niche positions of other species were held constant. Results None of the 26 species maintained both their realized-niche width and position along the latitudinal gradient. Few species (9 of 26: 35\%) shifted their realized-niche width, but all shifted their realized-niche position. With increasing latitude, most species (22 of 26: 85\%) shifted their realized-niche position for soil nutrients and pH towards nutrient-poorer and more acidic soils. Main conclusions Forest understorey plants shifted their realized niche along the latitudinal gradient, suggesting local adaptation and/or plasticity. This macroecological pattern casts doubt on the idea that the realized niche is stable in space and time, which is a key assumption of species distribution models used to predict the future of biodiversity, hence raising concern about predicted extinction rates.},

In this review, we discuss the physiological basis of leaf-level responses to sunflecks and the mechanisms plants use to tolerate sudden changes in PFD and leaf temperature induced by sunflecks. We also examine the potential effects of climate change stresses (including elevated temperatures, rising CO2 concentrations and drought) on the ability of tree species to use sunflecks, and advocate more research to improve our predictions of seedling and tree carbon gain in future climates. Lastly, while we have the ability to model realistic responses of photosynthesis to fluctuating PFD, dynamic responses of photosynthesis to sunflecks are not accounted for in current models of canopy carbon uptake, which can lead to substantial overestimates of forest carbon fixation. Since sunflecks are a critical component of seasonal carbon gain for shaded leaves, sunfleck regimes and physiological responses to sunflecks should be incorporated into models to more accurately capture forest carbon dynamics.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of canopy surface temperatures was conducted around a small and large gap at a forested alpine site in the Swiss Alps during the 2015 and 2016 snowmelt seasons (March–April). Canopy surface temperatures within the small gap were within 2–3°C of measured reference air temperature. Vertical and horizontal variations in canopy surface temperatures were greatest around the large gap, varying up to 18°C above measured reference air temperature during clear-sky days. Nighttime canopy surface temperatures around the study site were up to 3°C cooler than reference air temperature. These measurements were used to develop a simple parameterization for correcting reference air temperature for elevated canopy surface temperatures during (1) nighttime conditions (subcanopy shortwave radiation is 0 W m−2) and (2) periods of increased subcanopy shortwave radiation {$>$}400 W m−2 representing penetration of shortwave radiation through the canopy. Subcanopy shortwave and longwave radiation collected at a single point in the subcanopy over a 24 h clear-sky period was used to calculate a nighttime bulk offset of 3°C for scenario 1 and develop a multiple linear regression model for scenario 2 using reference air temperature and subcanopy shortwave radiation to predict canopy surface temperature with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.7°C. Outside of these two scenarios, reference air temperature was used to predict subcanopy incoming longwave radiation. Modeling at 20 radiometer locations throughout two snowmelt seasons using these parameterizations reduced the mean bias and RMSE to below 10 W m s−2 at all locations.},

This work used a global data set with estimates from a wide range of forest types, aged 20‒795~years, of their annual photosynthetic production (gross primary production, GPP) and subsequent above- plus below-ground biomass production (net primary production, NPP). Both GPP and NPP increased with increasing mean annual temperature and precipitation. GPP was then unrelated to forest age whilst NPP declined progressively with increasing age. These results implied that autotrophic respiration increases with age. It has been proposed that GPP should decline in response to increasing water stress in leaves as water is raised to greater heights as trees grow taller with age. However, trees may make substantial plastic adjustment in morphology and anatomy of newly developing leaves, xylem and fine roots to compensate for this stress and maintain GPP with age. This work reviews the possibilities that NPP declines with age as respiratory costs increase progressively in, any or all of, the construction and maintenance of more complex tissues, the maintenance of increasing amounts of live tissue within the sapwood of stems and coarse roots, the conversion of sapwood to heartwood, the increasing distance of phloem transport, increased turnover rates of fine roots, cost of supporting very tall trees that are unable to compensate fully for increased water stress in their canopies or maintaining alive competitively unsuccessful small trees.},

  abstract = {Organ temperature and variation therein plays a key role in plant functioning and its responses to e.g. climate change. There is a strong feedback between organ, especially leaf, temperature and the climate within the canopy (canopy climate), which in turn interacts with the climate outside the canopy (ambient climate). For greenhouses, the determinants of this interplay and how they drive differences between canopy and ambient climate are poorly understood. Yet, as many experiments on both regular greenhouse crops and field crops are done in greenhouses, this is crucial to know. Therefore, we designed an experiment to quantify the differences between ambient and canopy climate and leaf temperature. A path analysis was performed to quantify the interactions between components of the greenhouse canopy-climate system. We found that with high radiation the canopy climate can be up to 5°C cooler than the ambient climate, while for cloudy days this was only 2°C. Canopy relative humidity (RH) was up to 25\% higher compared to ambient RH. We showed that radiation is very important for these climate differences, but that this effect could be partly counteracted by turning off supplementary light (i.e. due to its indirect effects e.g. changing light distribution). Leaf temperature was substantially different, both higher and lower, from the canopy air temperature. This difference was determined by leaf area index (LAI), temperature of the heating pipe and the use of supplementary light, which all strongly influence radiation, either shortwave or thermal radiation. The difference between leaf and ambient air temperature could be decreased by decreasing the LAI or increasing the temperature of the heating pipe.},

How light-saturated net photosynthesis of tropical trees adapts to variation in temperature, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and further environmental factors, that change along elevation gradients, is not precisely known. With gas exchange measurements in mature trees, we determined light-saturated net photosynthesis at ambient temperature (T) and [CO2] (Asat) of 40 tree species from 21 families in tropical mountain forests at 1000-, 2000-, and 3000-m elevation in southern Ecuador. We tested the hypothesis that stand-level averages of Asat and leaf dark respiration (RD) per leaf area remain constant with elevation. Stand-level means of Asat were 8.8, 11.3, and 7.2~μmol~CO2~m−2~s−1; those of RD 0.8, 0.6, and 0.7~μmol~CO2~m−2~s−1 at 1000-, 2000-, and 3000-m elevation, respectively, with no significant altitudinal trend. We obtained coefficients of among-species variation in Asat and RD of 20–53\% (n~=~10–16 tree species per stand). Examining our data in the context of a pan-tropical Asat data base for mature tropical trees (c. 170 species from 18 sites at variable elevation) revealed that area-based Asat decreases in tropical mountains by, on average, 1.3~μmol~CO2~m−2~s−1~per~km altitude increase (or by 0.2~μmol~CO2~m−2~s−1 per K temperature decrease). The Asat decrease occurred despite an increase in leaf mass per area with altitude. Local geological and soil fertility conditions and related foliar N and P concentrations considerably influenced the altitudinal Asat patterns. We conclude that elevation is an important influencing factor of the photosynthetic activity of tropical trees. Lowered Asat together with a reduced stand leaf area decrease canopy C gain with elevation in tropical mountains.},

  abstract = {The gravitational component of water potential and frictional resistance during transpiration lead to substantial reductions in leaf water potential (Ψl) near the tops of tall trees, which can influence both leaf growth and physiology. We examined the relationships between morphological features and gas exchange in foliage collected near the tops of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) trees of different height classes ranging from 5 to 55~m. This sampling allowed us to investigate the effects of tree height on leaf structural characteristics in the absence of potentially confounding factors such as irradiance, temperature, relative humidity and branch length. The use of cut foliage for measurement of intrinsic gas-exchange characteristics allowed identification of height-related trends without the immediate influences of path length and gravity. Stomatal density, needle length, needle width and needle area declined with increasing tree height by 0.70~mm−2~m−1, 0.20~mm~m−1, 5.9~×~10−3~mm~m−1 and 0.012~mm2~m−1, respectively. Needle thickness and mesophyll thickness increased with tree height by 4.8~×~10−2~mm~m−1 and 0.74~μm~m−1, respectively. Mesophyll conductance (gm) and CO2 assimilation in ambient [CO2] (Aamb) decreased by 1.1~mmol~m−2~s−1~per~m and 0.082~μmol~m−2~s−1~per~m increase in height, respectively. Mean reductions in gm and Aamb of foliage from 5 to 55~m were 47\% and 42\%, respectively. The observed trend in Aamb was associated with gm and several leaf anatomic characteristics that are likely to be determined by the prevailing vertical tension gradient during foliar development. A linear increase in foliar δ13C values with height (0.042‰~m−1) implied that relative stomatal and mesophyll limitations of photosynthesis in intact shoots increased with height. These data suggest that increasing height leads to both fixed structural constraints on leaf gas exchange and dynamic constraints related to prevailing stomatal behavior.},

  abstract = {Estimating leaf temperature distributions (LTDs) in canopies is crucial in forest ecology. Leaf temperature affects the exchange of heat, water, and gases, and it alters the performance of leaf‐dwelling species such as arthropods, including pests and invaders. LTDs provide spatial variation that may allow arthropods to thermoregulate in the face of long‐term changes in mean temperature or incidence of extreme temperatures. Yet, recording LTDs for entire canopies remains challenging. Here, we use an energy‐exchange model (RATP) to examine the relative roles of climatic, structural, and physiological factors in influencing three‐dimensional LTDs in tree canopies. A Morris sensitivity analysis of 13 parameters showed, not surprisingly, that climatic factors had the greatest overall effect on LTDs. In addition, however, structural parameters had greater effects on LTDs than did leaf physiological parameters. Our results suggest that it is possible to infer forest canopy LTDs from the LTDs measured or simulated just at the surface of the canopy cover over a reasonable range of parameter values. This conclusion suggests that remote sensing data can be used to estimate 3D patterns of temperature variation from 2D images of vegetation surface temperatures. Synthesis and applications. Estimating the effects of LTDs on natural plant–insect communities will require extending canopy models beyond their current focus on individual species or crops. These models, however, contain many parameters, and applying the models to new species or to mixed natural canopies depends on identifying the parameters that matter most. Our results suggest that canopy structural parameters are more important determinants of LTDs than are the physiological parameters that tend to receive the most empirical attention.},

  abstract = {A trade-off between growth and mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated conditions under which the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r2 = 0.69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r2 = 0.46), and much weaker for large trees (r2 ≤ 0.10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (Hmax) are key traits among forest trees. Seed mass, LMA, WD, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait–demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of WD, the relationships were weak (r2 {$<$} 0.1 for three and r2 {$<$} 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43–44\% of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth–mortality trade-off; however, WD alone accounted for {$>$}80\% of the explained variation and, after WD was included, LMA and Hmax made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of SM, LMA, and Hmax occurred at all positions on the growth–mortality trade-off. Although WD provides a promising start, a successful trait-based ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Modern global temperature and land cover and projected future temperatures suggest that tropical forest species will be particularly sensitive to global warming. Given a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, fully 75\% of the tropical forests present in 2000 will experience mean annual temperatures in 2100 that are greater than the highest mean annual temperature that supports closed-canopy forest today. Temperature-sensitive species might extend their ranges to cool refuges, defined here as areas where temperatures projected for 2100 match 1960s temperatures in the modern range. Distances to such cool refuges are greatest for equatorial species and are particularly large for key tropical forest areas including the Amazon and Congo River Basins, West Africa, and the upper elevations of many tropical mountains. In sum, tropical species are likely to be particularly sensitive to global warming because they are adapted to limited geographic and seasonal variation in temperature, already lived at or near the highest temperatures on Earth before global warming began, and are often isolated from cool refuges. To illustrate these three points, we examined the distributions and habitat associations of all extant mammal species. The distance to the nearest cool refuge exceeded 1000 km for more than 20\% of the tropical and less than 4\% of the extratropical species with small ranges. The biological impact of global warming is likely to be as severe in the tropics as at temperate and boreal latitudes.},

Wright et al. analyzed leaf data for 7670 plant species, along with climatic data, from 682 sites worldwide. Their findings reveal consistent patterns and explain why earlier predictions from energy balance theory had only limited success. The authors provide a fully quantitative explanation for the latitudinal gradient in leaf size, with implications for plant ecology and physiology, vegetation modeling, and paleobotany. Science, this issue p. 917 Leaf size varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large leaves, the latitudinal gradient of leaf size has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic gradients in leaf size. This knowledge can enrich “next-generation” vegetation models in which leaf temperature and water use during photosynthesis play key roles. Day- and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences drive global gradients in leaf size. Day- and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences drive global gradients in leaf size.},

This climatic change could have a profound impact on tree growth and on the stability of forest ecosystems in this region, but at present evidence for these impacts is lacking. In this study, we report a recent dramatic decline in the growth of hemi-boreal forests, based on ring width measurements from three dominant tree-species (Pinus sylvestris, Larix sibirica and Larix gmelinii), sampled from eight sites in the region. We found that regional tree growth has become increasingly limited by low soil water content in the pre- and early-growing season (from October of the previous year to July of the current year) over the past 80 years. A warming-induced reduction in soil water content has also increased the climate sensitivity of these three tree species. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a clear decline in growth is evident for both the pine forests and the larch forests, although there are increasing trends in the proxy of soil water use efficiencies. Our findings are consistent with those from other parts of the world and provide valuable insights into the regional carbon cycle and vegetation dynamics, and should be useful for devising adaptive forest management strategies.},

  abstract = {Spectra of leaf traits in northern temperate forest canopies reflect major differences in leaf longevity between evergreen conifers and deciduous broadleaf angiosperms, as well as plastic modifications caused by within-crown shading. We investigated (1) whether long-lived conifer leaves exhibit similar intra-canopy plasticity as short-lived broadleaves, and (2) whether global interspecific relationships between photosynthesis, nitrogen, and leaf structure identified for sun leaves adequately describe leaves differentiated in response to light gradients. We studied structural and photosynthetic properties of intra-tree sun and shade foliage in adult trees of seven conifer and four broadleaf angiosperm species in a common garden in Poland. Shade leaves exhibited lower leaf mass-per-area (LMA) than sun leaves; however, the relative difference was smaller in conifers than in broadleaves. In broadleaves, LMA was correlated with lamina thickness and tissue density, while in conifers, it was correlated with thickness but not density. In broadleaves, but not in conifers, reduction of lamina thickness was correlated with a thinner palisade layer. The more conservative adjustment of conifer leaves could result from a combination of phylogenetic constraints, contrasting leaf anatomies and shoot geometries, but also from functional requirements of long-lived foliage. Mass-based nitrogen concentration (Nmass) was similar between sun and shade leaves, and was lower in conifers than in deciduous broadleaved species. Given this, the smaller LMA in shade corresponded with a lower area-based N concentration (Narea). In evergreen conifers, LMA and Narea were less powerful predictors of area-based photosynthetic rate (Amax(area)) in comparison with deciduous broadleaved angiosperms. Multiple regression for sun and shade leaves showed that, in each group, Amax(mass) was related to Nmass but not to LMA, whereas LMA became a significant codeterminant of Amax(mass) in analysis combining both groups. Thus, a fundamental mass-based relationship between photosynthesis, nitrogen, and leaf structure reported previously also exists in a dataset combining within-crown and across-functional type variation.},

  abstract = {Heatwave events are expected to become more frequent and intense in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in the future. However, our knowledge of the impacts of these extreme temperature events on ecosystem functions is still limited. We investigated the responses of ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) to heatwaves for nine sites encompassing a wide variety of ecosystem types with long-term (i.e., {$>$}7 years) flux and meteorological observations at northern mid-latitudes. Our results showed that GPP was depressed during heatwaves for most ecosystems except the C4 sites. The evaporative stress index (ESI) was the primary variable responsible for the changes in GPP during heatwaves across the nine ecosystems. Furthermore, forest ecosystems were more resistant and resilient to heatwaves than other ecosystems. Additionally, the asymmetric diurnal pattern of GPP in forest ecosystems was attributed to xylem refilling and high water storage capacity, indicating that GPP was more sensitive to heatwaves in the afternoon. Interestingly, C4 herbaceous ecosystems could promote canopy stomatal conductance (Gc) for avoiding leaf burn and tissue damage during heatwaves. The herbaceous ecosystems had weaker stomatal control on water loss during heatwaves and were more vulnerable to heatwaves owing to the water stress afterwards. This research highlighted the importance of ecosystem type and plant functional type in determining the responses of photosynthesis to heatwaves. Understanding the post-effect after heatwaves is also vital for comprehensively assessing the impacts of heatwaves on ecosystem functions.},

  abstract = {Leaves are organs sensitive to environmental changes in the process of evolution and may exhibit phenotypic plasticity as a response to abiotic stress. However, affirmation of leaf morphological plasticity and its regulations in different environments are still unclear. We performed a simulated experiment to study the variations of leaf morphology in different gradients of water and light availability. Considering different types of leaves and venation, we chose pinnate-veined simple leaves of Quercus acutissima and compound leaves of Robinia pseudoacacia as the study objects. The morphological parameters we investigated include leaf size, shape and venation pattern which can be easily measured in the field. Significant variations occurred in many parameters due to the effects of the environment and/or allometry. There were broadly consistent trends for leaf morphological variations along the gradients. The leaf size became smaller with a short supply of resources. Leaf elongation and fractions of the lamina area altered to enhance resources acquisition and conservation. Trade-offs between investments in support and functional structures optimized the venation pattern of major and minor veins. Leaflets partially played a role such as leaf teeth, for they are not only individual units, but also a part of the compound leaf. We suggest that more or less the same trends in morphological variations may be an important explanation for coexisting species to adapt to similar habitats and form the niche differentiation.},

  abstract = {1 Leaf respiratory temperature responses and general leaf properties of Quercus rubra were measured throughout the 2003 growing season in a deciduous forest in the north-eastern USA. Measurements were made in the upper and lower portions of the canopy at two sites with different soil water availability. Correlations among respiration and various leaf properties were examined. 2 At a set temperature (10 and 20 °C), area-based leaf respiration rates were higher in both the early and late growing season than in the mid-growing season (0·50 vs 0·33 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 at 10 °C, on average). Upper-canopy leaves generally had higher respiration rates than lower-canopy leaves (0·53 vs 0·30 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 at 10 °C, on average). At the drier site a more significant seasonal pattern in respiration was observed, while at the more mesic site a stronger canopy-position effect was detected. E0, a model variable related to the overall energy of activation of respiration, varied only slightly (52 ± 5 kJ mol−1 K−1), and was not influenced by season, site or canopy position. 3 Leaf properties (specific leaf area, nitrogen, soluble sugars) also varied with season, site and canopy position. Leaf N and reducing monose were positively correlated with leaf respiration rates. After isolating single factors (season, site, canopy position), reducing monose could partially explain the seasonality in respiration (32−79\%), and leaf N (Narea) was well correlated with the canopy-position effect. 4 Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial heterogeneities of respiration need to be considered in ecosystem models, but significant simplifications may be made in Q. rubra by assuming a constant temperature coefficient (E0, 52·5 kJ mol−1 in this study) or predicting the base respiration rate (R0) from well understood leaf properties.},

  abstract = {In conjunction with eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes at the 39.5-m height over a 21.5-m-tall boreal aspen stand in northern Saskatchewan, CO2 concentration was measured at eight heights in order to calculate net ecosystem exchange. During both leafless and full-leaf periods, daytime vertical CO2 concentration gradients above 9 m were weak ({$<$}0.2 μmol mol−1 m−1), but were strong below this height. Little change in CO2 storage in the air column below 39.5 m occurred during much of the daytime, while around sunrise and sunset CO2 storage changed mainly below 9 m. For the rest of the night, over 85\% of the increase in CO2 storage occurred above 9 m. On some calm nights during the growing season, CO2 also accumulated below 9 m resulting in a sudden upward CO2 flux at 39.5 m following the resumption of mixing 2–3 hours after sunrise. A 10-day experiment was conducted to determine the spatial variability of CO2 flux in the trunk space. Two eddy covariance systems were mounted just above the understory about two tree heights apart. The correlation between CO2 fluxes were poor even under unstable (daytime) conditions, suggesting a relatively heterogeneous understory and soil. In contrast, the correlation between water vapor fluxes was high (r2 = 0.70) in unstable conditions. However, average daytime and nighttime CO2 fluxes over the 10 days agreed to within 5\%. This suggests that partitioning net ecosystem exchange between overstory and understory on an hourly basis using a single-understory eddy covariance system is inadvisable; however, partitioning probably can be done quite reliably using 5-day average fluxes.},

The results showed that the performance index on a basis of absorption (PIabs), maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m) and potential activity of PS II (F-v/F-0) in the leaves from the E decreased more drastically than those from the W at noon, suggesting the severe photoinhibition in the leaves from the E. However, the photoinhibition was more severe in the leaves from the W in the afternoon. With the variation of photon flux density (PFD), ratio of variable fluorescence F-k to the amplitude F-J - F-o (W-k) increased firstly, then followed by a decrease in the two group leaves. However, efficiency that a trapped exciton moves an electron into the electron transport chain beyond Q(A)(-) (Psi(o)) and probability that an absorbed photon will move an electron into the electron transport chain (phi E-o) decreased firstly, then followed by an increase in the two group leaves. These results demonstrate that both the donor and acceptor sides of PS II were damaged in the leaves in different directions. Diurnal changes in dissipation per active reaction center indicate that the excessively excited energy per active reaction center was higher in the leaves from the E at noon while that was higher in the leaves from the W in the afternoon. The results also exhibited that Pl(abs) are more sensitive to the variation of PFD and can reflect the extent of photoinhibition in ginkgo leaves in more detail, compared with F-v/F-m, and F-v/F-o.}

  abstract = {Trees regulate canopy temperature (Tc) via transpiration to maintain an optimal temperature range. In diverse forests such as those of the eastern United States, the sensitivity of Tc to changing environmental conditions may differ across species, reflecting wide variability in hydraulic traits. However, these links are not well understood in mature forests, where Tc data have historically been difficult to obtain. Recent advancement of thermal imaging cameras (TICs) enables Tc measurement of previously inaccessible tall trees. By leveraging TIC and sap flux measurements, we investigated how co-occurring trees (Quercus alba, Q. falcata, and Pinus virginiana) change their Tc and vapor pressure deficit near the canopy surface (VPDc) in response to changing air temperature (Ta) and atmospheric VPD (VPDa). We found a weaker cooling effect for the species that most strongly regulates stomatal function during dry conditions (isohydric; P. virginiana). Specifically, the pine had higher Tc (up to 1.3°C) and VPDc (up to 0.3 kPa) in the afternoon and smaller sensitivity of both ∆T (=Tc − Ta) and ∆VPD (=VPDc − VPDa) to changing conditions. Furthermore, significant differences in Tc and VPDc between sunlit and shaded portions of a canopy implied a non-evaporative effect on Tc regulation. Specifically, Tc was more homogeneous within the pine canopy, reflecting differences in leaf morphology that allow higher canopy transmittance of solar radiation. The variability of Tc among species (up to 1.3°C) was comparable to the previously reported differences in surface temperature across land cover types (1°C to 2°C), implying the potential for significant impact of species composition change on local/regional surface temperature.},

  abstract = {1 Climate-driven changes in leaf respiration (R) in darkness have the potential to determine whether low productivity ecosystems exhibit positive or negative carbon balances. 2 We investigated whether sustained exposure to full sunlight, shade and seasonal drought alters the temperature response of leaf R of field-grown Quercus ilex subsp. ballota in a dry-land continental Mediterranean ecosystem. The plants studied, experience large diurnal and seasonal variations in temperature. 3 Whilst growth irradiance impacted on photosynthesis, it had little effect on the short-term temperature dependence of leaf R. Moreover, although basal rates of leaf R (i.e. rates of R at a common measuring temperature) were higher in sun-exposed than shade-exposed leaves, growth irradiance had little impact on the degree of acclimation to seasonal changes in temperature and/or moisture. Basal rates of leaf R were higher in winter than summer in both sun-exposed and shaded plants. Estimated Q10 values (i.e. proportional increase in R per 10 °C rise in temperature) for leaf R were greater in winter than summer; however, no seasonal variation was found in the apparent activation energy (E0) of leaf R. These observations were used to construct a simple Arrhenius model that fully accounted for both daily and seasonal variations in the temperature dependence of R in both sun-exposed and shaded plants. Crucial to the model was accounting for the seasonal and irradiance-dependent shifts in the basal rate of leaf R. 4 Although the balance between daily R and photosynthesis increased markedly in summer (particularly under full sun), the increase in this ratio was markedly less than would have been the case if leaf R had not acclimated to the high average day time temperatures in summer. 5 It is concluded that seasonal acclimation of leaf R plays a crucial role in determining the viability of tree growth in dry-land, low productivity forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Understanding the response of leaf respiration (R) to changes in irradiance and temperature is a prerequisite for predicting the impacts of climate change on plant function and future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Little is known, however, about the interactive effects of irradiance and temperature on leaf R. We investigated whether growth irradiance affects the temperature response of leaf R in darkness (Rdark) and in light (Rlight) in seedlings of a broadleaved evergreen species, Quercus ilex. Two hypotheses concerning Rdark were tested: (1) the Q10 (i.e. the proportional increase in R per 10 °C rise in temperature) of leaf Rdark is lower in shaded plants than in high-light-grown plants, and (2) shade-grown plants exhibit a lower degree of thermal acclimation of Rdark than plants exposed to higher growth irradiance. We also assessed whether light inhibition of Rlight differs between leaves exposed to contrasting temperatures and growth irradiances, and whether the degree of thermal acclimation of Rlight is dependent on growth irradiance. We showed that while growth irradiance did impact on photosynthesis, it had no effect on the Q10 of leaf Rdark. Growth irradiance had little impact on thermal acclimation when fully expanded, pre-existing leaves were exposed to contrasting temperatures for several weeks. When Rlight was measured at a common irradiance, Rlight/Rdark ratios were higher in shaded plants due to homeostasis of Rlight between growth irradiance treatments and to the lower Rdark in shaded leaves. We also showed that Rlight does not acclimate to the same degree as Rdark, and that Rlight/Rdark decreases with increasing measuring and growth temperatures, irrespective of the growth irradiance. Collectively, we raised the possibility that predictive carbon cycle models can assume that growth irradiance and photosynthesis do not affect the temperature sensitivity of leaf Rdark of long-lived evergreen leaves, thus simplifying incorporation of leaf R into such models.},

  abstract = {Variability in leaf mass per area (LMA) is largely explained by leaf anatomical traits. However, few studies have been conducted to explore the anatomical characteristics and the contribution of leaf anatomical traits to LMA for coexisting broadleaf species with different shade tolerances in same forests at a regional scale. Here, we analyzed variations in LMA and three leaf anatomical traits and the bivariate relationships among four leaf traits within three canopy layers for five major coexisting broadleaf species with different shade tolerances in four mixed broadleaved-Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forests along a latitude gradient in Northeast China. We focused on assessing the relative weight of the leaf anatomical traits to predict LMA and on exploring the correlations among leaf anatomical traits, shade tolerance and LMA by using structural equation modeling (SEM). In comparison to shade-tolerant species, relative shade-intolerant species had higher LMA and length of minor veins per unit area (VLAmin). LMA, palisade tissue thickness (PT) and VLAmin increased with the height of the canopy. The bivariate relationships among the three anatomical traits and LMA were significantly different among the five species, but there were no significant differences among the three canopy layers. LMA was directly enhanced by PT, epidermis thickness (ET) and VLAmin and directly decreased by shade tolerance as well as indirectly decreased by shade tolerance via leaf anatomical traits. Our results clearly suggest that shade tolerance is important for driving variations in key leaf traits, which will provide a better understanding of the drivers of trait variation as well as the application of functional traits in outlining mechanisms of forest dynamics and management.},

  abstract = {The river valleys in Southwest China are characterized by a dry–hot climate and relatively rich soils, and host valley-type savannas that are dominated by deciduous species. However, little is known about the ecological adaptations of Chinese savanna plants to the local environments. We hypothesize that Chinese savanna species mainly possess a drought-avoiding strategy by having a deciduous leaf habit and have productive leaf traits. To test this hypothesis, we measured 26 anatomical, morphological, physiological, and chemical traits for 33 woody species from a valley savanna in Southwest China and compared them with the literature data of other dry and wet tropical tree species and a global dataset. We found that Chinese savanna species showed drought avoidance adaptations and exhibited productive leaf traits, such as thin and dense leaves with high ratio of palisade to spongy mesophyll, leaf nutrient concentrations and photosynthetic capacity. Correlations of photosynthetic capacity with N, P, and stomatal conductance across Chinese savanna species were consistent with global patterns reported for seed plants. However, the Chinese savanna species had consistently greater carbon gain at a given specific leaf area, N, P, and stomatal conductance, suggesting higher nutrient- and intrinsic water use efficiencies. These results suggest that paradoxically, Chinese savanna species are adapted to the stressful dry–hot valley habitat by having productive leaves.},

  abstract = {Temperature responses and sensitivity of photosynthesis (An\_T) and respiration for leaves at different ages are crucial to modeling ecosystem carbon (C) cycles and productivity of evergreen forests. Understanding the mechanisms and processes of temperature sensitivity may further shed lights on temperature acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration with leaf aging. The current study examined temperature responses of photosynthesis and respiration of young leaves (YLs) (fully expanded in current growth season) and old leaves (OLs) (fully expanded in last growth season) of Quercus aquifolioides Rehder and E.H. Wilson in an alpine oak forest, southwestern China. Temperature responses of dark respiration (Rdark), net assimilation (An), maximal velocity of carboxylation (Vcmax) and maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) were significantly different between the two leaf ages. Those differences implied different temperature response parameters should be used for leaves of different ages in modeling vegetation productivity and ecosystem C cycles in Q. aquifolioides forests and other evergreen forests. We found that RuBP carboxylation determined the downward shift of An\_T in OLs, while RuBP regeneration and the balance between Rubisco carboxylation and RuBP regeneration made little contribution. Sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit changed in OLs and compensated part of the downward shift. We also found that OLs of Q. aquifolioides had lower An due to lower stomatal conductance, higher stomatal conductance limitation and deactivation of the biochemical processes. In addition, the balance between Rdark and An changed between OLs and YLs, which was represented by a higher Rdark/An ratio for OLs.},

  abstract = {Short-term temperature response curves of leaf dark respiration (R–T) provide insights into a critical process that influences plant net carbon exchange. This includes how respiratory traits acclimate to sustained changes in the environment. Our study analysed 860 high-resolution R–T (10–70°C range) curves for: (a) 62 evergreen species measured in two contrasting seasons across several field sites/biomes; and (b) 21 species (subset of those sampled in the field) grown in glasshouses at 20°C : 15°C, 25°C : 20°C and 30°C : 25°C, day : night. In the field, across all sites/seasons, variations in R25 (measured at 25°C) and the leaf T where R reached its maximum (Tmax) were explained by growth T (mean air-T of 30-d before measurement), solar irradiance and vapour pressure deficit, with growth T having the strongest influence. R25 decreased and Tmax increased with rising growth T across all sites and seasons with the single exception of winter at the cool-temperate rainforest site where irradiance was low. The glasshouse study confirmed that R25 and Tmax thermally acclimated. Collectively, the results suggest: (1) thermal acclimation of leaf R is common in most biomes; and (2) the high T threshold of respiration dynamically adjusts upward when plants are challenged with warmer and hotter climates.},

  abstract = {In many biomes, plants are subject to heatwaves, potentially causing irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Field surveys have documented global, temperature-dependent patterns in photosynthetic heat tolerance (PHT); however, it remains unclear if these patterns reflect acclimation in PHT or inherent differences among species adapted to contrasting habitats. To address these unknowns, we quantified seasonal variations in Tcrit (high temperature where minimal chlorophyll-a fluorescence rises rapidly, reflecting disruption to photosystem II) in 62 species native to 6 sites from 5 thermally contrasting biomes across Australia. Tcrit and leaf fatty acid (FA) composition (important for membrane stability) were quantified in three temperature-controlled glasshouses in 20 of those species. Tcrit was greatest at hot field sites and acclimated seasonally (summer {$>$} winter, increasing on average 0.34 °C per °C increase in growth temperature). The glasshouse study showed that Tcrit was inherently higher in species from warmer habitats (increasing 0.16 °C per °C increase in origin annual mean maximum temperature) and acclimated to increasing growth temperature (0.24 °C °C−1). Variations in Tcrit were positively correlated with the relative abundance of saturated FAs, with FAs accounting for 40\% of Tcrit variation. These results highlight the importance of both plastic adjustments and inherent differences determining contemporary continent-wide patterns in PHT.},

  abstract = {Ongoing global warming is causing phenological shifts that affect photosynthesis and growth rates in temperate woody species. However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warming—as is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn months—on autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4~°C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group. This underscores the need to consider differences among plant functional types when forecasting the future behaviour of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The canopies of large broad-leaf trees exhibit significant heterogeneity in both micro-environmental conditions and leaf morphology. Whether the visible differences in the size and shape of leaves from the top and bottom of the crown are determined prior to bud break or result from different patterns of leaf expansion is not known. Analysis of ontogenetic changes of both the degree of lobing and vein density in Quercus rubra demonstrates that leaves throughout the crown are identical in size and shape at the time of bud break. Morphological adaptation to the local micro-environment takes place during the expansion phase and starts after the determination of the vascular architecture has been completed. Leaves from the bottom of the crown undergo greater expansion in the tissue close to the main veins than occurs either in the more peripheral tissue of the same leaf or anywhere in leaves from the top of the crown. This results in a water transport system that is well suited to the low evaporative rates near the bottom of the crown, but inadequate for the conditions found at the top of the tree. Acclimation of leaf form and function based upon differential expansion may be entirely driven by the local hydraulic demand during the expansion phase, resulting in leaf size and vein density being determined during development by the same hydraulic properties which will constrain the size of leaf that can be functionally supported at maturity.},
