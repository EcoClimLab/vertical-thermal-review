Abstract and Figures
Leaf phenology varies markedly across tree species of temperate deciduous forests. Early leafing in spring may increase light capture and carbon gain prior to canopy closure, allowing saplings to survive in understory sites deeply shaded in midsummer. We quantified sapling leaf phenology for 18 tree species and seasonal variation in understory light availability at three sites along a ridge-slope-cove landform gradient in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Early leafing species (e.g., Aesculus flava, Carpinus caroliniana) broke bud an average of 24 d before late leafers (e.g., Magnolia fraseri, Nyssa sylvatica). Canopy closure occurred 14-18 d earlier and summer understory light was on average 63-74% lower on intermediate and mesic sites than on the xeric site. Early leafing species intercepted 45-80% of their growing season photon flux before canopy closure vs. 8-15% for late leafers. However, earlier leafing increased exposure to freezing temperatures by 5.5% per week near the mean time of bud break. Early leafing is strongly correlated with midsummer shade, risk of freezing temperatures, and distribution on mesic sites across a "main spectrum" of 15 deciduous species. Differences in leaf phenology and resultant impacts on spring carbon gain may help determine tree shade tolerance and distribution in southern Appalachian forests.

Shade tolerance — the ability to survive and grow in shaded
microsites — is a key factor determining the distribution of plant
species and growth forms across spatial and successional gradi-
ents ( Horn, 1971 ; Givnish, 1988 ; Canham et al., 1994 , 2006 ;
Kobe, 1996 , 1999 ; Pacala et al., 1993 ; Montgomery and
Chazdon, 2002 ; Reich et al., 2003 ; Kneeshaw et al., 2006 ).
Ecophysiological studies aimed at explaining differences
among species in shade tolerance have focused mainly on dif-
ferences in (1) static and dynamic photosynthetic light responses
at the leaf level (e.g., Bj ö rkman, 1981 ; Chazdon, 1988 ; Givnish,
1988 ; Lei and Lechowicz, 1990 ; Ellsworth and Reich, 1992 ;
Kitajima, 1994 ; Walters and Reich, 1999 ; Valladares et al.,
2000 ; Montgomery and Chazdon, 2002 ; Givnish et al., 2004 );
(2) leaf susceptibility to photoinhibition and other forms of
photodamage ( Powles and Bj ö rkman, 1981 ; Kursar and Coley,
1999 ; Adams et al., 2004 ; Valladares et al., 2005 ); (3) canopy
geometry and self-shading ( Horn, 1971 ; Pearcy and Yang,
1996 , 1998 ; Valladares and Pearcy, 1999 ; Naumburg et al.,
2001 ); and (4) resource allocation to photosynthetic vs. non-
photosynthetic tissues ( Givnish, 1988 ; Givnish et al., 2004 ;
Montgomery, 2004 ; Kneeshaw et al., 2006 ). Much less atten-
tion has been focused on the role of leaf phenology — that is, the
timing of leaf ﬂ ush, expansion, photosynthetic activity, and se-
nescence — in determining shade tolerance.
Early leaﬁ ng by plants in the forest understory permits pho-
tosynthesis for a period of time under brightly lit conditions
before the canopy closes ( Harrington et al., 1989 ; Givnish,
1990 , 2002 ; Uemura, 1994 ; Gill et al., 1998 ; Seiwa, 1998 ;
Komiyama et al., 2001a, b ; Augspurger and Bartlett, 2003 ;
Tomita and Seiwa, 2004 ; Augspurger et al., 2005 ; Augspurger,
2008 ). Saplings of early leaﬁ ng trees (e.g., Aesculus ﬂ ava ,
Carpinus caroliniana , Halesia tetraptera var . monticola ) in
temperate, deciduous forests might ﬁ x large amounts of carbon
before the forest canopy closes, providing a “ spring carbon sub-
sidy ” that could permit such plants to persist in moist, fertile
sites that are densely shaded in midsummer ( Givnish, 1992 ,
2002 ; Augspurger, 2008 ). In contrast, saplings of late-leaﬁ ng
deciduous species (e.g., Nyssa sylvatica , Quercus rubra ), whose
leaves are expanded close to or after canopy closure would not
gain such a subsidy and thus should lack shade tolerance based
on their time of leaﬁ ng. In addition, the advantage of a spring
carbon subsidy should be less on drier, less fertile sites that per-
mit substantial light to penetrate the canopy. Late leafers might
gain an advantage in midsummer photosynthesis under brightly
lit conditions (i.e., in gaps), based on their possession of large
xylem vessels with high hydraulic conductance and on the ten-
dency for leaf-level photosynthetic rates to be positively corre-
lated with stomatal conductance, transpiration rates, and stem
hydraulic conductance (e.g., see Wong et al., 1979 ; Sobrado,
1993 ; Brodribb and Feild, 2000 ; Sperry, 2000 ; Santiago et al.,
2004 ; Franks, 2006 ). Although late leaf senescence is often cor-
related with early leaf expansion across species ( Lechowicz,
1984 ), any “ fall subsidy ” is much less likely than the spring

MA TERIALS AND METHODS
Species and study sites — This investigation was conducted in Great Smoky
Mountains National Park (GSMNP), a world heritage and biosphere reserve
site in Tennessee and North Carolina, USA. GSMNP lies along an ancient
northeast-southwest axis of the southern Appalachians, uplifted 200 – 300 Mya
( King et al., 1968 ; Schulz et al., 2000 ) and now the center of tree diversity in
eastern North America ( Whittaker, 1956 ; Wood, 1970 ). In the Great Smokies,
tree species distributions and diversity are strongly associated with elevational
and aspect gradients across which several environmental conditions change,
including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, insolation, temperature, evapo-
rative demand, and soil fertility ( Whittaker, 1956 ). At a given elevation, species
distributions are strongly correlated with a landform gradient extending from
north-facing, concave mesic coves, through open slopes of intermediate soil
moisture and fertility, to south-facing, convex dry, infertile ridges ( Whittaker,
1956 ). The environmental gradient in soil depth and moisture availability from
ridge to cove implied by Whittaker has been corroborated by direct environ-
mental measurements at the Coweeta Experimental Forest nearby ( Yeakley
et al., 1998 ; Elliott et al., 1999 ). Of the common tree species that occur between
760 – 1370 m a.s.l., we selected 16 deciduous and two evergreen species for in-
tensive study, stratiﬁ ed by taxonomic afﬁ nity, ecological distribution, timing of
leaf ﬂ ush, and apparent degree of shade tolerance ( Table 1 ). Nomenclature
throughout follows APG II (2003) and Weakley (2007) .
Species selection was made prior to selection of our speciﬁ c ﬁ eld research
sites using data in Robert Whittaker ’ s (1956) classic paper on the vegetation of
the Great Smoky Mountains. We ﬁ rst computed the sum of total abundance (%
stems) for each tree species across all stations (e.g., landform positions) of the
mesic – xeric gradients studied by Whittaker (1956 , tables 2 and 3 ) in elevational
bands at 760 – 1070 and 1070 – 1370 m a.s.l., and then ranked each species by
total abundance at each elevational band. Of the most abundant 20 species in
each elevational band, we excluded “ duplicate ” species in each genus (or sub-
subsidy for the same species, given the greater likelihood of
drought or reductions in leaf area (e.g., due to herbivory or pre-
vious drought) in late summer or early fall.
Several authors have now shown that early leaf expansion can
result in substantial increases in light capture and carbon gain
( Harrington et al., 1989 ; Gill et al., 1998 ; Seiwa, 1998 ; Tomita
and Seiwa, 2004 ; Augspurger et al., 2005 ) by individual tree and
shrub species during spring in temperate, deciduous forests.
These increases in light capture and carbon gain can positively
inﬂ uence growth and survival ( Augspurger, 2008 ). Conse-
quently, avoidance of canopy shade via early leaﬁ ng appears
likely — albeit paradoxically — to serve as a mechanism to in-
crease shade tolerance in some species. Essential to this proposed
mechanism is the observed tendency for saplings to leaf earlier
than adults of the same species ( Gill et al., 1998 ; Augspurger et
al., 2005 ). Studies to date have generally focused on only one or
a few species, have not examined how the signiﬁ cance of the
time of leaﬁ ng for carbon capture would vary along environmen-
tal gradients and, most importantly, have not addressed how the
difference in timing of leaﬁ ng relates to understory light avail-
ability and affects the magnitude of the “ spring subsidy. ”
Such analyses are necessarily complex. Evaluating the impor-
tance of early leaﬁ ng to whole-season carbon capture of tree sap-
lings requires the measurement of (1) sapling leaf phenology; (2)
seasonality of canopy transmittance and understory photon ﬂ ux
density (PFD: µ mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ s − 1 ); (3) static and dynamic photosyn-
thetic light responses; (4) respiration rates and construction costs
of leaves and associated organs; (5) shade tolerance, deﬁ ned as
survival rate as a function of PFD; (6) risks associated with early
leaﬁ ng (e.g., probability of killing frost); (7) stem hydraulic con-
ductance; and (8) how each of these parameters or functions vary
with species and environmental conditions.
Here we present the ﬁ rst steps of such an analysis, focusing on
18 common species along the ridge – slope – cove landform gradi-
ent characteristic of mid elevations in the Great Smoky Moun-
tains National Park ( Whittaker, 1956 ) and reporting on variation
in sapling leaf phenology in relation to the timing and extent of
canopy closure in a mesic, concave cove; intermediate slope; and
xeric, convex ridge. Our overarching hypothesis is that early leaf-
ing provides a carbon subsidy that allows early leafers to persist
on microsites that are densely shaded in midsummer and ex-
cludes late leafers from such sites. In this paper, we test two spe-
ciﬁ c hypotheses. First early leaﬁ ng will result in an increase in
light capture during spring. Second, saplings of early leaﬁ ng de-
ciduous species will dominate moist, fertile sites that favor dense
canopies, while late leafers will dominate less fertile, drier, more
open canopies sites ( Givnish, 2002 ). In testing these hypotheses,
we address ﬁ ve main questions: (1) How do species differ quan-
titatively in sapling leaf phenology (i.e., timing of bud break and
leaf drop, rate of leaf expansion, and leaf longevity)? (2) To what
extent are different components of sapling leaf phenology corre-
lated across species? (3) How do sites differ in the timing and
extent of canopy closure? (4) How does the proportion of light
incident on leaves during the spring phase (i.e., before canopy
closure) vary with sapling phenology and the timing and extent
of canopy closure? And (5) how do various components of sap-
ling leaf phenology correlate with the distribution of adults of
that species along the landform gradient and with the timing and
extent of canopy closure at the point along that gradient where
each species is most abundant? Our data shed light on each of
these questions and provide new insights into the possible causes
of differences among temperate deciduous tree species in shade
tolerance and distribution along landscape gradients.

November 2008] Lopez et al. — Leaf phenology in southern Appalachian trees
910 m a.s.l.) to minimize the effect of elevation and highlight the impact of
landform and slope aspect. The use of a single site for each landform category
may limit the generality of our results. However, the composition of these sites
accords with the general patterns documented along landform gradients by
Whittaker (1956) and the need for repeated access to sites for related physiolog-
ical studies prevented our sampling a greater number of sites.
Leaf phenology — In late winter 2002, we extensively searched our focal
sites for saplings of our study species. Individuals chosen for phenological
measurements were selected prior to bud break, < 3 m tall, and scattered widely
in our focal sites. Buds chosen were readily accessible from the ground and
scattered around the periphery of the canopy of each individual on undamaged
healthy twigs. To avoid confounding effects of sapling position on leaf phenol-
ogy, we choose individuals with the same aspect. During the early spring (ca. 1
March) of 2002 and 2003, 1 – 3 apical buds were tagged using colored telephone
wires on each of 10 – 12 individuals per species. After leaf ﬂ ush, one target leaf
per bud was marked and censused at intervals of 3 – 5 days until the leaf had
completed expansion. At each census, opening of bud scales (= bud break), ap-
pearance of leaves, leaf number per bud, and leaf blade length (cm) were re-
corded. After full leaf expansion was reached, the census frequency was
decreased to approximately once a month, and only the total number of leaves
was recorded. In autumn, the census interval was increased again to intervals of
3 – 5 days, and percentage green leaf tissue and total number of leaves per bud
were recorded until more than 90% of the leaves had died (i.e., desiccated),
disappeared (i.e., fallen or completely eaten), or discolored (i.e., turned pale
yellow). In addition to direct observation of leaf length and the dates of bud
break, complete leaf expansion, and leaf fall, we used our census data to calcu-
late (1) date of 50% leaf expansion; (2) the rate of expansion at 50% leaf expan-
sion; (3) date of 50% leaf fall, which we calculated as the time at which 50% of
the leaves had fallen or discolored; and (4) functional leaf longevity, the num-
ber of days between 50% expansion and 50% leaf fall. Phenological data for
leaf expansion and leaf fall phenophases were expressed as leaf ratios: a leaf
length ratio — leaf blade length at census date divided by the ﬁ nal leaf length
at full expansion; and a leaf area ratio — green leaf area at census date divided
by total leaf area before leaf fall.
Quantiﬁ cation of light environment, landform distribution, and probabil-
ity of freezing temperatures — At each site, we deployed 32 gallium arsenide
photodiodes (GAsPs, Hamamatsu, Newark, New Jersey, USA) previously cali-
brated with a Li-Cor SA-190 Quantum and a Li-Cor 1000 data logger (Li-Cor,
Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Sensors were placed on steel stakes at 1.2 m height
every 5 m along a single transect at the center of each site. This array allowed
us to characterize the amount of light penetrating to saplings below canopy at
three different sites, in a way that would not reﬂ ect differences in sapling height
among sites. Each sensor was connected to a relay multiplexer M-416 con-
trolled by a CR21X data logger with an SM-64 data storage module (Campbell
Science, Logan, Utah, USA). Average photon ﬂ ux density (PFD: µ mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ s − 1 )
for each sensor was logged every 10 s during daylight hours during the 2002
and 2003 growing seasons. Each data logger was powered by a 12 V lead-acid
battery and protected from bears and boars using an electriﬁ ed barrier. Batteries
and data storage modules were replaced at roughly 3-week intervals.
To characterize midsummer light environments experienced by individual
saplings of each species, we shot hemispherical canopy photographs over each
census plant during summer 2003, using a tripod-mounted Nikon Coolpix 995
digital camera with 180 ° ﬁ sheye lens converter. All canopy photographs were
taken under overcast sky conditions, with the camera oriented north and lev-
eled. We set the black – white threshold for each hemispherical photograph by
determining the lower edge of the right-hand (brighter) peak in its luminosity
histogram in Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California, USA); this
procedure corrects for differences in overall brightness among photographs and
greatly increases repeatability. We used this threshold in the program Hemiview
v.2.1 (Delta-T devices, Cambridge, UK) to estimate the proportion of visible
sky (VSky), the indirect site factor (ISF, proportion of indirect radiation pene-
trating the canopy), and the corresponding direct site factor (DSF) ( Rich, 1990 ).
It is important to recognize that these photographs do not fully represent the
distribution of each species, given that our selection of individuals was not
stratiﬁ ed across a full light gradient from large gaps (essentially nonexistent at
our study sites, due to infrequent canopy disturbance in GSMNP) to densely
shaded understories, nor were individuals sampled across an extensive land-
scape. Nevertheless, even this limited sample provides important insights into
species distributions and possible ties of phenology to light regime, given that
shade-intolerant species will perforce not be found in the microsites most
densely shaded in midsummer.
genus in Quercus ) that share the same general time of leaﬁ ng (early, mid, late)
and apparent shade tolerance (described later) with one or more congeners. We
did this to minimize a well-known potential bias in comparative studies, involv-
ing the inclusion of closely related species that are (often) ecologically
similar.
The issue of “ duplicate ” species involved the following taxa: (1) Acer pensyl-
vanicum , A. saccharum , and A. spicatum all share high shade tolerance and early
leaﬁ ng; (2) Betula allegheniensis and B. lenta share moderate tolerance and mid
to late leaﬁ ng; (3) Quercus alba and Q. prinus of subg. Quercus share shade in-
tolerance and late leaﬁ ng; (4) Quercus rubra and Q. coccinea of subg. Eryth-
robalanus share shade intolerance and late leaﬁ ng; and (5) Pinus pungens and P.
rigida also share shade intolerance and late leaﬁ ng. We studied the more com-
mon species in each pair, except for B. lenta , which we chose to increase knowl-
edge of this common but little-studied species that is sister to B. allegheniensis
( J ä rvinen, 2004 ). We included (6) A. rubrum because its mid leaﬁ ng and moder-
ate shade tolerance contrast with A. saccharum ; A. rubrum is thus not a duplicate
species, and it is also the most common tree species at mid elevations in the
Great Smokies and nearby ranges ( Whittaker, 1956 ; Bolstad et al., 2001 ).
Finally, we had to exclude a few species originally planned for study be-
cause they had become rare or inaccessible on our study sites since Whittaker ’ s
(1956) survey. These included Castanea dentata (mostly vanished due to chest-
nut blight); Carya glabra (a shade-intolerant, gap-phase species, with many
large individuals seen, but few saplings with foliage readily accessible and thus
suitable for our studies); Robinia pseudoacacia (for reasons similar to those
given for C. glabra ); and Hamamelis virginiana (which has apparently under-
gone a previously unreported decline since the 1950s). We substituted Carya
cordiformis for C. glabra ; its somewhat greater shade tolerance made it possi-
ble to locate saplings suitable for study. We substituted Carpinus caroliniana
for Hamamelis , which it resembles in shade tolerance, early leaﬁ ng, ecological
distribution, and stature. We were unable for logistical reasons to complete a
survey of leaf phenology in Pinus pungens , so this species (whose shade intol-
erance, late leaﬁ ng, and occurrence on xeric sites are shared with several other
species already included) was struck from the analysis. Our species differ in
stature ( Table 1 ) from subcanopy to canopy trees. Although our study necessar-
ily focused on juvenile trees, it should also have relevance to the ecology of
larger individuals. A recent analysis of > 50 tropical tree species suggests that
physiological traits of adults are strongly related, if not determined, by the en-
vironment of the juvenile ( Poorter, 2007 ). Those results suggest that the forest
understory environment represents a strong selective ﬁ lter, through which all
species must pass, regardless of adult stature.
Initial stratiﬁ cation of leaf phenology was based on qualitative observations
(T. Givnish) in GSMNP between 1990 and 2000. Degree of shade tolerance
was scored on the traditional ﬁ ve-point scale (1 = very shade-intolerant, 5 =
very shade-tolerant) using data collated from Peet and Loucks (1977) and Ni-
inemets and Valladares (2006) . Time of leaﬁ ng was not used to infer shade
tolerance in either study. The indices from Peet and Loucks (1977) reﬂ ect the
relative abundance of species in understories vs. canopies, while those from the
Niinemets and Valladares (2006) meta-analysis largely reﬂ ect the responses to
questionnaires compiled by Baker (1949) . We recognize that any qualitative
index of shade tolerance can suffer from multiple shortcomings, including vari-
ation in a species ’ performance across different microsites, geographic loca-
tions, and plant sizes (see Givnish, 1988 ; Beckage et al., 2000 ; Bond, 2000 ), or
more importantly, lack of a quantiﬁ ed relationship of growth or survival to light
level (sensu Kobe et al., 1995 ; Pacala et al., 1993 ; Montgomery and Chazdon,
2002 ) on which operational measures of shade tolerance can then be based. The
shade tolerance indices listed in Table 1 were used to ensure that species with
saplings of high, intermediate, and low tolerance were included in our study;
subsequent analyses involving carbon balance and sapling survival under dif-
ferent canopy conditions will inevitably reﬁ ne and quantify these initial
rankings.
Three sites representing mesic coves on concave, north-facing sites; inter-
mediate slopes; and xeric ridges on convex, south-facing sites and their corre-
sponding forest communities were chosen for study in the Tennessee portion of
GSMNP. Mesic and xeric sites were located along the Brushy Mountain Trail
(35 ° 41 ′ 06 ″ N, 83 ° 24 ′ 32 ″ W, elevation 880 m a.s.l.) in the Greenbrier area, while
the intermediate site was situated on an open, southeast-facing slope along the
Bullhead trail (35 ° 40 ′ 08 ″ N, 83 ° 29 ′ 34 ″ W, elevation 910 m a.s.l.) near Twin
Creeks. All sites were located in mature to old-growth stands, in a portion of
GSMNP where canopy disturbance is rare, and consequently, large canopy
gaps are essentially absent. We chose sites that were relatively easily accessible
for a wide variety of phenological, physiological, and ecological studies, and
that collectively included substantial numbers of saplings of the species under
study. Our focal sites (each ca. 1 ha) spanned a small elevational range (880 –

signiﬁ cant. For each species × site combination, we estimated the proportion of
growing-season PFD gained before canopy closure by integrating average un-
derstory PFD between 50% sapling leaf expansion and canopy closure on a
given site, then dividing it by the integral of average PFD between 50% leaf
expansion and 50% leaf loss.
We used principal component analysis (PCA) to distill our numerous inter-
correlated variables into a few explanatory factors ( McCune and Grace, 2002 ).
The objective was to determine the number of signiﬁ cant dimensions of varia-
tion among a series of phenological and habitat traits that are, in many cases,
closely correlated with each other. The resulting orthogonal principal compo-
nents were then used to examine the relationships among ecological distribu-
tions, leaf phenology, and environmental characteristics across species.
Variables in the PCA included bud break, dates at full leaf expansion and com-
plete drop, leaf longevity, dates of 50% leaf expansion and leaf drop, rates of
expansion at 50% leaf expansion, VSky, ISF, DSF, proportion of PFD inter-
cepted before canopy closure, and the probability of freezing temperatures at or
after bud break. The Julian date of complete leaf fall for evergreen species was
set arbitrarily at 365.
All data were analyzed with the statistical software JMP v 3.2.1. (SAS Insti-
tute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). We related time of leaﬁ ng to position along
Whittaker ’ s mesic – xeric gradient using Pearson correlations and least mean
squares (LMS) regressions. Time of leaﬁ ng was characterized by the date of
bud break and the date of 50% leaf expansion. One-tailed t tests were used
when a speciﬁ c sign in the relationship was predicted a priori; two-tailed tests
were used otherwise. We used standard, phylogenetically unstructured analyses
throughout, given that (1) the angiosperm species under study are distributed
widely across 11 families and seven orders, with estimated times of divergence
between families of 47 – 143 My based on the maximum-likelihood analysis of
Wikstr ö m et al. (2001) ; (2) the closest within-family relatives were chosen to be
phenotypically divergent rather than convergent; and (3) extensive ecological
character evolution and reversal can occur in woody plants even over short pe-
riods of 5 – 10 My ( Givnish et al., 2004 ; see also Ackerly and Reich, 1999 ;
Givnish et al., 2005 ).
RESUL TS
Light environment across sites — Understory PFD
(mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ d − 1 ) was high and temporally variable on each site
in spring before canopy closure, averaging 8.7 ± 0.7
mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ day − 1 on the xeric site, 7.5 ± 0.6 mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ day − 1 on the
intermediate site, and 6.1 ± 0.5 mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ day − 1 on the mesic
site (Fig. 1). These differences were signiﬁ cant ( F
1,30 = 9.32,
Species distributions along the landform gradient were quantiﬁ ed by calcu-
lating the average site position of each species along Whittaker ’ s (1956) 13-
step, mesic – xeric gradient at 760 – 1070 m a.s.l. (see Table 2 in Whittaker,
1956 ), weighted by its share of stem density, and then converting to a scale in
which the most mesic sites received a score of 0 and the most xeric sites a score
of 100. We used this elevational band for the analysis because it encompasses
the range of elevation in our study sites (e.g., 880 – 910 m a.s.l.). We calculated
the average date of 50% leaf expansion (based on our measurements) for all
deciduous taxa at each station on Whittaker ’ s gradient, weighting each species
by its stem density in his Table 2 . This calculation assumes no variation in time
of leaﬁ ng across the gradient within each species and is designed to illustrate
how differences in the distribution and relative timing of leaﬁ ng of individual
species alone would inﬂ uence the average time of leaﬁ ng. Because no data were
provided in Whittaker ’ s Table 2 for the distribution and abundance of Carpinus
caroliniana and Carya cordiformis , our calculations excluded these species.
However, calculations that used the distribution of Hamamelis for Carpinus ,
and that of Carya glabra for C. cordiformis yielded similar results (O. Lopez,
R. Montgomery, and T. Givnish, unpublished data).
We estimated freezing probabilities as a sigmoid function (described in Sta-
tistical analysis ) of Julian date (January 1 = 1) using minimum daily tempera-
tures in a 56-yr record from Asheville NC, about 90 km ESE of our study sites
(35 ° 26 ′ 10 ″ N, 82 ° 32 ′ 30 ″ W, 700 m a.s.l.). This approach ignores variation in
frost probability due to site convexity. At a given elevation, the likelihood of
nightly freezing may be less on convex ridge sites (which permit cold-air drain-
age) than on concave cove sites (which receive cold-air drainage from above).
Statistical analysis — Site factors — We averaged daily PFD across all func-
tioning sensors at each site using two years of data and calculated the daily
standard error for PFD based on the number of such sensors. Due to bear and
boar activity, occasionally sensors were damaged or destroyed resulting in no
data for the damaged sensors in the time between damage and repair (usually < 1
wk). To estimate the date of canopy closure, we used linear regressions relating
PFD to date during the linear decline of PFD in the spring, then calculated the
date at which the model PFD would equal the average PFD during June (the
time of maximal canopy cover). Average spring and summer PFD were calcu-
lated using the daily PFD values before and after canopy closure, respectively.
The probability of a spring freeze was estimated by ﬁ tting the sigmoid function
(see Lockhart, 1983 ) f ( x ) = a /(1+exp − (
x −
x 0 )/
b ) (Eq. 1) to the proportion of years
for each date x (January – June) for which the daily minimum temperature was
≤ 0 ° C, based on the 56-yr record from Asheville, North Carolina.
Species factors — ANOVA and Tukey – Kramer honestly signiﬁ cantly differ-
ent (HSD) tests were used to determine whether interspeciﬁ c differences in
various components of light environment and leaf phenology were statistically

November 2008] Lopez et al. — Leaf phenology in southern Appalachian trees
Characterization of species light environment — Species
varied signiﬁ cantly in VSky, ISF, and DSF ( F 18,231 = 4.61, 4.23
and 4.85, respectively, P < 0.0001, ANOVA; Appendix S1, see
Supplemental Data with the online version of this article). Spe-
cies tended to have the most signiﬁ cant differentiation with re-
spect to VSky, and the least with respect to DSF (Appendix S1;
see online Supplemental Data). Halesia tetraptera var . monti-
cola tended to occur in the shadiest summer microsites, while
Nyssa sylvatica occurred in the most sunlit. At the intermediate
site, where 12 of 18 study species occurred, DSF differed sig-
niﬁ cantly across species ( F 11,145 = 2.74, P = 0.003, ANOVA),
with Ilex , Oxydendrum , and Quercus rubra occurring in signiﬁ -
cantly brighter microsites.
Leaf phenology — Species differed signiﬁ cantly in date of
bud break ( F 15,135 = 67.15, P < 0.0001), expansion rates at 50%
leaf expansion ( F 15,135 = 39.75, P < 0.0001), date of leaf fall
( F 15,135 = 25.24, P < 0.0001), and leaf longevity ( F 15,135 = 15.24,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 2, Table 2 ). Early leaﬁ ng Aesculus ﬂ ava , Hale-
sia tetraptera var . monticola , Cornus ﬂ orida , and Carpinus
caroliniana broke bud an average of 24 d before late-leaﬁ ng
Magnolia fraseri , Betula lenta , Ilex opaca , and Fagus grandifo-
lia (Fig. 2). Most earlier leafers required more time to expand
P < 0.005 for repeated measures ANOVA applied to daily
data); the xeric site received the most light before canopy clo-
sure (albeit decreased by the presence of a few evergreen
canopy trees), while the mesic site received the least. After
canopy closure, understory PFD decreased sharply at all sites
(Fig. 1). Although the absolute magnitudes of differences
among sites decreased, the relative differences increased,
with the xeric site receiving 1.9 ± 0.2 mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ day − 1 ; the in-
termediate site, 0.5 ± 0.01 mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ day − 1 ; and the mesic site,
0.7 ± 0.02 mol ⋅ m − 2 ⋅ day − 1 . Thus, while understory PFD on the
xeric site averaged 43% higher than that on the mesic site in
spring, by summer this difference had grown to 280%, reﬂ ect-
ing the much greater density of the canopy on the mesic site.
All differences among sites in understory PFD after canopy
closure were signiﬁ cant ( F 1,175 = 66.02, P < 0.0001 for re-
peated measures ANOVA). A dense understory layer of Acer
pensylvanicum on the intermediate site reduced light levels at
sensor level slightly below those on the mesic site. Finally,
the canopy closed earliest in the mesic cove (average date =
May 7) and latest on the xeric ridge (May 25), with the inter-
mediate site closing at a date between these extremes (May
11). There was thus an 18-d difference among sites in date of
canopy closure.

derstory light availability in spring before canopy closure (Julian date 80 – 120) vs. after leaf fall (Julian date 280 – 330).

November 2008] Lopez et al. — Leaf phenology in southern Appalachian trees
higher in early leafers over their growing season (Fig. 5B: r
2 =
0.94, P < 0.0001 for 16 df, two-tailed t test; r
2 = 0.68, P <
0.0001 excluding Aesculus ). Early leaﬁ ng Aesculus ﬂ ava re-
ceived 80% of its total growing-season PFD before canopy clo-
sure, in contrast to late-leaﬁ ng Magnolia fraseri and Nyssa
sylvatica , which received ca. 10% of growing-season PFD in
spring (Fig. 5A). Despite these marked differences, all species
achieved considerable light capture before canopy closure (Fig.
5B).
Early leaﬁ ng and associated gains in potential light capture
came with a signiﬁ cantly increased risk of freezing tempera-
tures (Fig. 6 ; r 2 = 0.97, P < 0.0001 for 16 df). Based on meteo-
rological data, the probability of freezing temperatures from
late winter until the onset of the summer showed a sigmoid
pattern, dropping most rapidly between March 1 and April 10
( y = 0.68/(1 + exp-[( x − 78.7)/14.9]; r 2 = 0.98, P < 0.0001). A
10-d delay in bud break around March 1 (i.e., from March 1 to
March 11) reduced the absolute risk of freezing temperatures
by 11%.
Species ordination (PCA) in relation to phenology param-
eters and light environment — Principal component analysis of
species phenological and light-environment characteristics
produced three signiﬁ cant axes (Fig. 7A). The ﬁ rst axis of these
explained 55% of the variance in the data and was positively
correlated with the dates of bud break ( r = 0.81, P < 0.0001),
50% expansion ( r = 0.90, P < 0.0001), full expansion ( r = 0.79,
P < 0.0001), and (for deciduous species) leaf fall ( r = 0.71, P <
0.003), as well as with functional leaf lifespan ( r = 0.60, P <
0.02; Fig. 7B). In addition, PCA axis 1 was signiﬁ cantly posi-
tively correlated with all measures of understory light avail-
ability ( r = 0.58 for Vsky, r = 0.63 for ISF, r = 0.56 for DSF,
P < 0.05 in all cases, two-tailed t test; r = 0.90 for ISF + DSF,
P < 0.0001). These correlations resulted in a species gradient
along axis 1 from early leafers with relatively short leaf lon-
gevity occupying densely shaded microsites (e.g., Aesculus ,
Halesia ) to evergreens ( Tsuga , Ilex ) with late bud break and
long leaf longevity and late-leaﬁ ng, deciduous taxa ( Nyssa ,
Oxydendrum , Quercus ) with long leaf longevity in more
brightly lit sites (Fig. 7A). This species gradient also showed
strong, highly signiﬁ cant correlations of early leaﬁ ng with %
PFD intercepted before canopy closure ( r = − 0.90, P < 0.0001)
and with a higher risk of an early spring freezing event ( r =
− 0.83, P < 0.0001). Much of the variation along axis 2, which
accounts for 20% of the variance in the trait data, is positively
correlated with the proportion of open sky (i.e., Vsky) ( r =
0.73, P < 0.0001) and the amount of indirect sunlight (i.e., ISF)
penetrating the canopy ( r = 0.67, P < 0.01), separating species
associated with very shaded sites ( Halesia tetraptera var . mon-
ticola , Carpinus caroliniana , Acer saccharum ) from those oc-
curring under relatively open canopies ( Nyssa sylvatica ,
Quercus rubra , Oxydendrum arboreum ). Axis 3 explains only
11% of the variance among species.
Earliest-leaﬁ ng and -dropping Aesculus and the two ever-
green species (in which time of leaﬁ ng and length of photosyn-
their leaves (Fig. 3A), and — except for earliest-breaking Aescu-
lus — had lower rates of leaf expansion (Fig. 3B). Leaf expan-
sion rates at 50% leaf expansion varied from 0.03 cm ⋅ d − 1 in
Tsuga to 1.18 cm ⋅ d − 1 in Fagus ( Table 2 ). Fagus was the last
species to break bud but the fastest to achieve full leaf expan-
sion; it required less than 14 d to achieve full expansion, while
other species required 36 d on average. Fagus lagged the aver-
age date of 50% full leaf expansion in other species by less than
one day, and reached full leaf expansion 8.3 d before the aver-
age of other species, ranking third in the latter regard. Earliest-
leaﬁ ng Aesculus had exceptionally rapid leaf expansion among
early leafers and tied for second place behind Fagus overall
(Fig. 3B). Expansion rates at 50% full expansion increased with
date of bud break among deciduous species but only when Aes-
culus is excluded as an outlier (Fig. 3B: r
2 = 0.323, P < 0.08 for
13 df). Date of 50% leaf fall increased signiﬁ cantly with date of
50% full expansion across deciduous species ( r
2 = 0.658, P <
0.01 for 14 df), but this relationship disappeared when Aesculus
was excluded ( r
2 = 0.295, P > 0.25 for 13 df). Paralleling a pat-
tern documented by Lechowicz (1984) , some early leafers (e.g.,
Carpinus caroliniana , Carya cordiformis ) drop their leaves
late, and some late leafers (e.g., Nyssa ) drop their leaves early.
However, there were many exceptions to this rule, and we note
that the two earliest leafers ( Aesculus ﬂ ava , Halesia tetraptera
var . monticola ) were also earliest to shed their leaves, at least at
the sapling stage, becoming deciduous 40 – 78 d before Carya
cordiformis .
Functional leaf longevity, the time from 50% leaf expansion
to 50% leaf drop in deciduous species, ranged from 116 d in
Aesculus ﬂ ava to 180 d in Carya cordiformis . Leaf longevity
increased with date of bud break across deciduous species ( P <
0.04), but again the signiﬁ cance of this relationship disappeared
when Aesculus was excluded ( P > 0.2). Similarly, leaf longev-
ity increased with date of bud break across all deciduous spe-
cies ( r = 0.52, P < 0.05), but that relationship vanished when
Aesculus was excluded ( r = 0.32, P > 0.2). Leaf longevity in-
creased signiﬁ cantly with the date of 50% leaf drop across de-
ciduous species, regardless of whether Aesculus was included
( y = 0.73 x – 40.8, r
2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test with 14
df) or excluded ( y = 0.98 x – 107.7, r
2 = 0.94, P < 0.0001).
Taken together, these patterns indicate that long leaf lifespan is
achieved mainly by delaying leaf fall in autumn, rather than by
early leaf ﬂ ushing in spring.
Phenology, topographic position, and predicted light inter-
ception — As expected, across deciduous species, the date of
50% leaf expansion — averaged across species weighted by
their abundance — increased toward more xeric sites, indicating
that early leafers dominated more mesic sites (Fig. 4). Across
deciduous species, earlier leaﬁ ng placed sapling leaves in a
bright understory light environment for a longer period and re-
sulted in higher estimated fractions of total growing season
PFD intercepted prior to canopy closure (Fig. 5A : r
2 = 0.99,
P < 0.0001 for 14 df, two-tailed t test; r
2 = 0.94, P < 0.0001
excluding Aesculus ). Absolute interception of PFD was also

DISCUSSION
This study documents extensive variation in the time of leaf-
ing among saplings of common deciduous tree species growing
at mid elevations in the southern Appalachians. Earliest-leaﬁ ng
Aesculus ﬂ ava achieved 50% leaf expansion 33 d before latest-
leaﬁ ng Magnolia fraseri and Nyssa sylvatica (Fig. 2, Table 2 ).
Such differences in leaf phenology may have profound effects
on the ability of saplings to survive in microsites densely shaded
in midsummer, by permitting photosynthesis for long peri-
ods under brightly lit conditions before the canopy closes
( Harrington et al., 1989 ; Givnish, 1990 , 2002 ; Uemura, 1994 ; Gill
et al., 1998 ; Seiwa, 1998 ; Komiyama et al., 2001a, b ; Augspurger
and Bartlett, 2003 ; Tomita and Seiwa, 2004 ; Augspurger et al.,
2005 ).
The ability to survive and grow under canopies of a given
density can be a function of several factors, including physio-
logical variation at the leaf level ( Bj ö rkman, 1981 ; Givnish,
1988 ; Pearcy, 1990 ; Valladares et al., 1997 ; Givnish et al.,
2004 ), plant height ( Givnish, 1988 ), canopy geometry ( Horn,
1971 ; Valladares et al., 2002 ), allocation to root tissue ( Givnish,
1988 ), drought or ﬂ ooding stress ( Valladares and Pearcy, 2002 ;
Sack, 2004 ; S á nchez-G ó mez et al., 2006 ; Niinemets and
Valladares, 2006 ; Lopez and Kursar, 2007 ), seedling inability
to penetrate deep litter ( Givnish 1998 ; Metcalfe and Turner,
1998 ; Sayer 2006 ), susceptibility to pathogens in shaded or

PCA plot (Fig. 7A). The remaining species occupy a diagonal
“ main spectrum ” from early leafers at lower left, associated
with low midsummer light levels and a high probability of
freezing temperatures early in the growing season, to late leafers
at upper right, associated with more open canopies and a lower
risk of freezing temperatures. As expected, most aspects of spe-
cies ’ leaf phenology, ecological distribution, midsummer light
environment and exposure to freezing temperatures show strong
collinearity along the main spectrum, with early leaﬁ ng, densely
shade summer microsites, and high risk of freezing tempera-
tures varying together (Fig. 7C). Across species along the main
spectrum, as the date of 50% leaf expansion increases, there are
signiﬁ cant increases in direct radiation (DSF: r = 0.53, P <
0.05), indirect radiation (i.e., ISF, r = 0.54, P < 0.05), and per-
centage open sky (i.e., VSky, r = 0.64, P < 0.01).

documenting the importance of leaf phenology for shade toler-
ance across a diverse set of temperate deciduous tree species
growing in mature forests in the southern Appalachians. Our
data demonstrate that earlier times of leaﬁ ng increase the total
amount of light intercepted by saplings under a given forest
canopy, as well as the fraction of light captured before canopy
closure (Fig. 4). Our data corroborate and extend work in Illi-
nois on early leaﬁ ng Aesculus glabra and Acer saccharum that
showed signiﬁ cantly reduced growth and increased mortality
when the spring “ window of light ” was removed using artiﬁ -
cial shading ( Augspurger, 2008 ). We expect the beneﬁ t of ear-
lier leaﬁ ng in terms of light capture and early season carbon
gain to be greatest on mesic, concave landforms, whose can-
opy closes earlier and often casts denser shade in midsummer
than those on open slopes or xeric, convex ridges (Fig. 1, Table
2 ). In such sites, we expect that early leaﬁ ng represents one
mechanism underlying differences among species in shade
tolerance.
In eastern North America, the forests of the southern Appala-
chians are a center of temperate tree diversity. Within these for-
ests, species occur nonrandomly, showing signiﬁ cant species
turnover across landform gradients ( Whittaker, 1956 ). Under-
standing the environmental and functional diversity underlying
species distribution patterns within this landscape was a major
goal of our research. Our PCA revealed a “ main spectrum ” of
species associated with the landform gradient. At one end of the
spectrum are early leaﬁ ng species that experience low midsum-
mer light levels and occur on moister, more fertile cove forest
sites. At the other end of the spectrum are late leafers that expe-
rience higher midsummer light levels and occur on drier, more
nutrient-poor ridge forest sites.
Three species, Aesculus , Tsuga , and Ilex , fall far from this
main spectrum, suggesting that they employ different func-
tional strategies compared to the species of the “ main spectrum ”
(Fig. 7). Rapid leaf expansion and early leaf fall set Aesculus
apart. These traits parallel the strategy of many spring ephemer-
als that co-occur with Aesculus in cove forests ( DePamphilis
and Neufeld, 1989 ; Small and McCarthy, 2002 ). Cove sites
have densely shaded understories in midsummer and our photo-
synthetic data (not shown) suggest that Aesculus operates very
close to its light compensation point during midsummer. As
such, the returns on continued investment in leaf tissue as the
summer progresses are likely small. The evergreen species
(e.g., Ilex , Tsuga ) differ from the main spectrum species (and
Aesculus ) in their long lifespans and late production of new
1404 American Journal of Botany [V ol. 95
leaves, but are functionally more similar to early leaﬁ ng taxa as
overwintered leaves likely become photosynthetically active
before sympatric deciduous species ( Givnish, 2002 ). Within a
habitat, evergreens should be more shade tolerant than decidu-
ous species, given their longer payback period for leaf construc-
tion costs and longer seasonal window of photosynthetic
activity. Across habitats, evergreens should be less shade toler-
ant, given their frequent restriction to poor soils and the heavy
belowground costs such soils impose ( Givnish, 2002 ).
The spring “ window of light ” in temperate deciduous forests
corresponds to a relatively high solar angle, abundant moisture
due to snow deposition, and/or reduced evaporation during
winter, and a ﬂ ush of soil nutrients ( Muller and Bormann, 1976 ;
Hutchison and Matt, 1977 ; Givnish, 2002 ; Augspurger and
Bartlett, 2003 ), but the corresponding autumn “ window ” tends
to be much darker and drier. Not surprisingly, Harrington et al.
(1989) found that two shrub species in Wisconsin oak forests
showed little photosynthesis during fall, despite showing high
rates of photosynthesis and acquiring up to 35% of their annual
carbon input during the spring window. Sapling photosynthesis
under leaﬂ ess canopies should thus be much more energetically
productive in spring than in fall.
Early leaﬁ ng comes with an increased risk of exposure to
freezing temperatures (Fig. 6). The risk of freezing tempera-
tures decreases by about 5.5% per week around the time of bud
break, corresponding to a relative reduction in risk of 51%. Al-
though it is uncertain how detrimental freezing temperatures
might be to buds and leaves of the study species, the costs of
replacing leaves damaged by freezing temperatures would be
effectively greater on drier, less fertile sites, given the greater
investments in roots required to replace nutrients lost in dam-
aged leaves ( Givnish, 2002 ). Thus, even though early spring is
the one time of year when moisture is reliably in abundant sup-
ply on xeric sites, selection there against loss of leaves to poten-
tial late frosts could favor the observed dominance of infertile,
dry sites by late leafers.
Early leaﬁ ng may help some tree species escape damage by
late-emerging insect herbivores ( Feeny, 1970 ; Seiwa, 1998;
Aizen and Patterson, 1995 ). However, early leafers — the only
woody species with soft, young leaves present in early spring —
are exceptionally exposed to vertebrate herbivory. It is likely no
accident that the earliest leafers — Aesculus ﬂ ava and its rela-
tives (e.g., A. sylvatica , DePamphilis and Neufeld [1989 ]) —
typically show almost no leaf damage by any herbivore (T.
Givnish, personal observation); buckeyes are highly toxic, pro-
tected by high levels of the coumarin glycoside aesculin, and
the ground leaves, fruits, and buds of Aesculus have been used

November 2008] Lopez et al. — Leaf phenology in southern Appalachian trees
as ﬁ sh poisons ( Russell et al., 1997 ). Late leafers (e.g., Quercus )
commonly occur on xeric sites and typically have young leaves
that rapidly expand, tough adult leaves, and high concentrations
of condensed tannins ( Forkner et al., 2004 ; Matsuki and Koike,
2006 ), as expected among plants exposed to herbivorous in-
sects in a nutrient-poor habitat.
Ecologists have long recognized that seasonal variation in
understory light availability tracks cycles in solar angle, cloudi-
ness, and canopy closure ( Salisbury, 1916 ; Anderson, 1964 ;
Hutchison and Matt, 1977 ; Hashimoto and Aoki, 1996 ). Land-
form position also affects understory light availability: our
ridge stand received 16% more understory PFD before canopy
closure than did a forested open slope, and 43% more than did
a mesic, concave cove. Presumably, much of the observed vari-
ation in understory PFD among sites is due proximally to site
differences in canopy density; there is a strong increase in leaf
area index — measured via litterfall — in moving from ridges to
coves in nearby Nantahala National Forest ( Bolstad et al.,
2001 ). However, site differences in insolation due to landform
position, convexity, and shading by the surrounding landscape
should also play an important role in determining solar input
and evaporative demand (e.g., see Dubayah and Rich, 1995 ;
Wang et al., 2006 ). Landform position — associated with a vari-
ety of environmental factors, including moisture supply, evapo-
rative demand, soil thickness, soil fertility, ﬁ re frequency, leaf
area index, and rate of tree growth ( Whittaker, 1956 ; Helvey
and Patric, 1988 ; Elliott et al., 1999 , 2002 ; Bolstad et al., 2001 ;
Boerner, 2006 ) — is also correlated with time of canopy closure,
with canopy trees leaﬁ ng earlier on more mesic sites (Fig. 1).
Earlier and more complete canopy closure on more mesic stands
should not only favor early leaﬁ ng in saplings on such sites, but
also favor herbs over shrubs (as observed by Whittaker [1956 ]),
based on expected differences between life-forms in whole-
plant light compensation points ( Givnish, 2002 ). The greater
density of foliage on more mesic sites — and lower light pene-
tration to the groundlayer (Fig. 1 and see also Bolstad et al.,
2001 ; Fig. 7 for our study species) — may thus be an important
driver of tree species distributions, in addition to any direct ef-
fects of soil conditions on the context-speciﬁ c survival, growth,
and competitive ability of such species. Simply put, dense early
leaﬁ ng canopies on mesic sites may help exclude late-leaﬁ ng, less
shade tolerant trees and permit only early leaﬁ ng, more shade-
tolerant tree species to persist. The more open canopies and
higher costs associated with leaf replacement due to late frosts
on xeric sites should work against early leaﬁ ng tree species and
favor dominance by late leafers. Differences in leaf phenology
thus appear to play a key role in determining not only the shade
tolerance of individual species, but also differences in their dis-
tributions at the landscape and community levels.
Avoidance of canopy shade via early leaﬁ ng appears to be an
important, albeit paradoxical, mechanism to persist in shady
environments and thereby affect the ecological distribution in
tree species of southern Appalachian forests. This study shows
that 10 – 80% of growing season photon ﬂ ux density arrived
prior to canopy closure; that time of leaﬁ ng has a larger effect
on light capture on mesic sites, whose canopies close rapidly
and achieve dense coverage, than on xeric sites with more open
and slowly closing canopies; that earlier leaﬁ ng is associated
with species occupying more densely shaded microsites; and
that earlier leaﬁ ng is signiﬁ cantly correlated with tree sapling
distribution on more concave landforms. These results suggest
a close tie of shade tolerance to time of leaﬁ ng, although this tie
should be conﬁ rmed with more rigorous metrics of growth and
survival as a function of PFD (see Kobe, 1996 , 1999 ; Pacala et al.,
1993 ; Montgomery and Chazdon, 2002 ). Moreover, future re-
search is needed to quantify the gains in photosynthesis, whole-
plant growth, and competitive ability associated with differences
in time of leaﬁ ng and time of canopy closure, based on seasonality
in static and dynamic photosynthetic light responses, photosyn-
thetic limitation by hydraulic conductance, and habitat-speciﬁ c
shifts in phenology and biomass allocation. Such research would
contribute to our understanding of the role of leaﬁ ng phenology
as a determinant of shade tolerance.

Abstract. The litter is the organic layer on the forest ground and has a variety of ecological functions. The litterfall is the main source of litter. The structure of forest canopy affects most ecologic processes such as the net primary production and litterfall in forest ecosystems. This research study focused on the exploration of the changes of litterfall based upon canopy closure of Uludağ fir forests. The study area was selected from Bolu Aladağ forests. Ten litterfall traps were systematically emplaced under the stand. The litterfall accumulated in each trap was collected monthly. The hemisphere photographs of the canopy closures above the stands were analysed with Gap Light Analyzer (GLA) software. The canopy closures were calculated separately for each hemisphere photographs with angles expanded in the multiples of 10° angle of view. The highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.359) was found between the amount of total litterfall (333.5 g•m⁻²•y⁻¹) and the canopy closure at 20° angle of view. The canopy closure values observed at 20° angle of view varied between 6.4% and 83.3%. Different mathematical models were developed to estimate the amount of litterfall fractions based on the canopy closure values at 20° angle of view. The coefficients of determination (R²) for the models developed as part of this study are 0.93 for foliar, 0.82 for seed and 0.83 for wood fraction. Practitioners can estimate the amounts of litterfall components, spreading distances and the accumulating amounts based on the distance by using the mathematical models developed in this study.

... As this study focus on phenology and water cycling, we briefly review how these processes are influenced by tree characteristics and local environment. Phenology timing varies among tree species, which favours early-leafing species but can also expose them to late frosts (Lopez et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2018). Many studies report that leaf development starts earlier and leaf senescence occurs later in the understory compared to the overstorey (Gill et al., 1998;Seiwa, 1999a;Augspurger and Bartlett, 2003;Schieber, 2006;Vitasse, 2013;Gressler et al., 2015), which allows the understory trees to benefit from a longer growing period and consequently, to increase their productivity (Jolly et al., 2004). ...
... The better growth predictions obtained for the small trees when the phenology was calculated at the individual scale highlight the importance of the "phenological avoidance strategy" displayed by understory trees. This had already been mentioned by Lopez et al. (2008) who observed that early-leafing species received between 45 % and 80 % of their photon flux during the budburst period. Moreover, a simulation study showed that a 1-week (2-week) lengthening of the understory vegetation period with regard to the overstorey in both spring and autumn generated a productivity increase of 32 % (55 %) on such a short period (Jolly et al., 2004). ...

Climate change affects forest growth in numerous and sometimes opposite ways, and the resulting trend is often difficult to predict for a given site. Integrating and structuring the knowledge gained from the monitoring and experimental studies into process-based models is an interesting approach to predict the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. While the first generation of models operates at stand level, one now needs spatially explicit individual-based approaches in order to account for individual variability, local environment modification and tree adaptive behaviour in mixed and uneven-aged forests that are supposed to be more resilient under stressful conditions. The local environment of a tree is strongly influenced by the neighbouring trees, which modify the resource level through positive and negative interactions with the target tree. Among other things, drought stress and vegetation period length vary with tree size and crown position within the canopy. In this paper, we describe the phenology and water balance modules integrated in the tree growth model HETEROFOR (HETEROgenous FORest) and evaluate them on six heterogeneous sessile oak and European beech stands with different levels of mixing and development stages and installed on various soil types. More precisely, we assess the ability of the model to reproduce key phenological processes (budburst, leaf development, yellowing and fall) as well as water fluxes. Two two-phase models differing regarding their response function to temperature during the chilling period (optimum and sigmoid functions) and a simplified one-phase model are used to predict budburst date. The two-phase model with the optimum function is the least biased (overestimation of 2.46 d), while the one-phase model best accounts for the interannual variability (Pearson's r=0.68). For the leaf development, yellowing and fall, predictions and observations are in accordance. Regarding the water balance module, the predicted throughfall is also in close agreement with the measurements (Pearson's r=0.856; bias =-1.3 %), and the soil water dynamics across the year are well reproduced for all the study sites (Pearson's r was between 0.893 and 0.950, and bias was between −1.81 and −9.33 %). The model also reproduced well the individual transpiration for sessile oak and European beech, with similar performances at the tree and stand scale (Pearson's r of 0.84–0.85 for sessile oak and 0.88–0.89 for European beech). The good results of the model assessment will allow us to use it reliably in projection studies to evaluate the impact of climate change on tree growth in structurally complex stands and test various management strategies to improve forest resilience.

... For instance, warm temperatures can increase respiration, potentially accelerating losses of carbon, which are hard to compensate for under low light conditions (Valladares et al. 2016), whereas high nutrient availability can enhance the seedling growth responses to light (Portsmuth and Niinemets 2007). Understorey plants, including tree seedlings, receive a large portion of the total light captured throughout the growing season by growing their leafs before overstoreys close up (Augspurger et al. 2005; Lopez et al. 2008) . Warming can lead to an earlier start of the growing season for seedlings due to earlier leaf burst (e.g. ...

The observed species differences in seasonal leaf length extension (Fig. 2) and concomitant seasonal leaf CHL filling (Fig. 3) support the conclusion by Lopez et al.

The authors found that early leafing greatly increased interception of growing season photon flux before canopy closure by temperate deciduous tree species in a Southern Appalachian forest. ...
Leaf chlorophyll plasticity in advanced regeneration of co-occurring Acer pensylvanicum and Fagus grandifolia beneath deciduous forest canopy

The chemical trait ‘total chlorophyll content per unit leaf area’ (CHL) has long been recognized to confer plasticity within a genetically fixed range of phenotypic variance. The plasticity of leaf CHL (PCHL) was assessed with special reference to saplings of the two morphologically divergent tree species Acer pensylvanicum L. (AP) and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. (FG) which co-occur in the eastern deciduous forest biome of North America. A randomized block design with repeated measures was used to field-test the hypothesis that low leaf display efficiency favoured selection for higher PCHL in FG than in AP. Species were tested in the shade of closed forest canopy at naturally low soil fertility and following applications of mineral NPK to test the second hypothesis that nutrient-poor soils select for high PCHL. Results support the first hypothesis of higher phenotypic PCHL and higher developmental PCHL in FG than in AP. Moreover, a markedly more dynamic CHL increase coincided with more rapid leaf development in FG compared to AP. Differential leaf phenology likely contributed to high PCHL in FG. Results also support, in the case of FG, the second hypothesis that nutrient-poor soils favour phenotypic PCHL. This is, however, not true for AP and confirms a lower shade tolerance rank for AP. Results strongly suggest that the ecological conditions for advanced regeneration in deep shade on nutrient-poor soils maintain high PCHL in FG populations.

Tamm reviews Linking forest growth with stand structure: Tree size inequality, tree growth or resource partitioning and the asymmetry of competition
Article

    David I Forrester David I Forrester

Stand structure can strongly influence forest growth and other processes, such as the water balance, carbon partitioning, nutrient cycling and light dynamics. However, individual structural variables can be positively or negatively correlated with growth. This is the case for variables such as size inequality and those that describe resource partitioning, such as the degree of symmetric/asymmetric competition and growth dominance. Several contrasting growth-structure correlations are reviewed and linked to forest processes by considering the different types of tree interactions they are associated with. Contrasting growth-structure correlations appear to converge when they are examined using a simple framework where stand growth is a function of three variables as opposed to any one of the variables alone; stand density, size distributions and tree size-growth relationships. The size distributions quantify how the stand density is distributed between the different sizes while the size-growth relationships quantify how growth is partitioned between different sizes. Size inequality may not often be a useful explanatory variable and instead it appears to sometimes correlate with growth because it can be correlated with other variables that influence growth. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the effects of structure on growth have received little attention and a long-term growth and yield data set from central Europe was used to examine how the effects of structure can change along climatic gradients. The simple framework of three variables could be used to separate the effects of structure and functioning when comparing mixed and monospecific forests, as well as to design silvicultural interventions or to determine whether past management interventions have achieved their goals. The implications for selecting which structural variables to use and when scaling up to the stand level, are also discussed.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) is the most visited National Park in the United States and has the highest levels of biodiversity of any park unit. It is a relatively small park (∼210,433 ha), but topographically complex, with an elevational range of 1757 m. The Park has historically been subject to elevated levels of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Ozone trends are analyzed from 1989 to 2016 for six monitoring sites in and adjacent to GRSM and ranging in elevation from 564 m to 2030 m. Low-elevation sites have minimum O 3 concentrations in early morning and maximum concentrations in mid-to late afternoon. High-elevation sites have flatter profiles, smaller diurnal ranges, and maxima that occur in early evening or at night. The W126 24-h exposure index increases with elevation up to 823 m, after which it plateaus. W126 24- h exposures increased between the years 1989–∼2002, and have substantially decreased afterwards. The highest 1-h concentration ever recorded in the Park was 135 ppb, which occurred on 25 August 1998. At most sites the maximum 3-month W126 24-h exposures have shifted from mid-summer to spring (Apr–Jun). Decreases in exposure result primarily from reduction of hourly averaged O 3 concentrations ≥ 60 ppb. Ozone episodes (3 or more consecutive hours when O 3 ≥ 60 ppb) have decreased in frequency, magnitude, and duration from 1999 to 2016. Decreases in W126 exposures are correlated with lowered NOx emissions from regional TVA power plants and appear to be a direct result of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) call associated with the Clean Air Act Amendments, resulting in the cleanest air in GRSM over the period of record. Lower cumulative W126 O 3 exposures and reduction in high O 3 concentrations appear to be having beneficial effects on the vegetation within the Park.

Extended leaf phenology has limited benefits for invasive species growing at northern latitudes

    BIOL INVASIONS

    Erin O’Connell

Many understory woody invasive plants in North America leaf out earlier or retain leaves later than their native associates. This extended leaf phenology is thought to grant invasive species an advantage over native species because spring and fall are crucial times for light access and carbon acquisition in understory habitats. However, it is unclear whether this advantage persists at northern latitudes where freezing temperatures constrain growing season length and low light levels reduce carbon gain. To investigate the costs and benefits of extended leaf phenology at northern latitudes, we observed leaf phenology, estimated total carbon gain, measured growth, and tested susceptibility to freezing temperatures for four native and four invasive woody shrubs in a disturbed forest in northern Minnesota, USA. We found that the invaders leafed out simultaneously with the natives in the spring but retained their leaves later in the autumn than native species. This extended fall phenology did not enable greater total carbon gain for the invaders because they assimilated less carbon earlier in the year than the natives. There was also no significant difference between native and invasive species in their susceptibility to freezing temperatures. Instead freezing tolerance related more to native range then leaf phenology. Our results suggest that freezing temperatures do not limit invasive species’ northern expansion and instead indicate that at the northern edge of their ranges, these species may lose any competitive advantage granted by extended leaf phenology over their native associates. This study demonstrates the importance of considering latitude and forest structure when investigating phenology and growth.

The leaf phenology of upper trees and the growth response of plants : a transplanting experiment on Impatiens textori

Deciduous broad-leaved trees show a remarkable specific difference in the leaf-flush period in spring. Even under the closed canopy, the light condition of forest floor becomes heterogeneous by place, because of the leaf phenological traits of upper trees. In order to study the influence of this seasonal light regime on the growth of understory plants, the transplanting experiment of Impatiens textori, an annual herbaceous species, was conducted in a ca. 100-year-old forest. Five plots were established under the canopies of early-, intermediate-, and late-flushing trees, and the elongation pattern of main stems of transplanted individuals was monitored. It is elucidated that the growth increments of them were large in the place under influence of the late-flushing-tree canopy, that supplied large amount of photosynthetic photon flux density to the forest floor for a long period in spring.

We quantified leaf phenologies of saplings and overstory trees of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), and the shrub hobblebush viburnum (Viburnum alnifolium Marsh.) in a 72-year-old northern hardwood forest. Seasonal changes in irradiance in the shrub layer, and in the leaf CO2 exchange of viburnum, and sugar maple and beech saplings were also measured. Leaf expansion occurred earlier in the spring and green leaves were retained later in the autumn in saplings and shrubs than in overstory trees. During the spring light phase (before overstory closure), large CO2 gains by all three shrub-layer species occurred as a result of a combination of relatively large leaf area, high photosynthetic capacity, and high irradiance. Throughout the summer shade phase, photosynthetic capacity at a given irradiance remained relatively constant, but CO2 gain was typically limited by low irradiances. Even though irradiance in the shrub layer increased during the autumn light phase as the overstory opened, CO2 gains were modest compared to springtime values because of declining leaf area and photosynthetic capacity in all three species. The CO2 gains during the spring light phase, and to a lesser extent during the autumn light phase, may be important to the carbon balance and long-term persistence of saplings and shrubs in the usually light-limited shrub layer of a northern hardwood forest. Therefore, for some late-successional species, leaf phenology may be an important characteristic that permits their long-term persistence in the shrub layer of mature northern hardwood forests.

Focussed on woodlands of over 500 years of age, the volume draws on many detailed examples from East Anglia. Having reviewed the principal sources of woodland history, chapters on woodland soils, flowering plants and tree communities illustrate the variety of detail within woods. There are accounts of the prehistory and history of woodlands, their management and products, the wood-pasture system, and the way in which the use and management of woodlands have related to wider economic and social issues. Almost half the text is devoted to an explanation of the character and development of oak, elm, lime and other distinctive woodland- types, and to the histories of the beech and birch trees in England. -J.

Few scientists understand better than H. L. Penman (1963) the complexity of finding out what happens to the rain: “With few exceptions, they [i.e., field measurements] involve small differences between large quantities (of water) that cannot be measured with precision—rainfall, interception, surface runoff, streamflow, soil water content, stored water, deep percolation.”

コ ナラ二次林の林冠下に生育する稚樹のCO2交換について, 4年生個体を対象として調べ, 枯死にいたる外的および内的要因を分析した。林冠下において葉の光合成生産を高めるうえで重要な光合成光反応曲線の初期勾配は, 成長期の大部分を通じて高いレベルにあり, 季節によるちがいは小さかった。成長期における個体の葉の年総光合成量と呼吸量および非同化器官の呼吸量は, 1993年と1994年の平均で, それぞれ29.7, 17.8, 12.5×103μmol CO2 seedling-1と推定され, CO2収支はほぼ均衡していた。成長期における個体の炭素収支は, 林床日射量の高い成長期の初めに蓄積した余剰生産物をそれ以降で消費する形で推移し, とくに夏場では高温による呼吸の増大で収支が破綻しやすいと見られた。葉の純生産率とC/F比との関係が検討され, 年齢を経た個体ではC/F比の10から20%の上昇により葉の純生産率が半分以下にまで低下することが示された。試算された生存限界C/F比は5付近にあ り, 稚樹群の枯死過程を議論するうえで有用であった。

A Gradient Analysis of Southern Wisconsin Forests

While study of southern Wisconsin forests has led to numerous conceptual advances in ecology, a clear understanding of variation in these factors in relation to environmental factors and successional processes has failed to emerge. The present study was undertaken to (1) determine the principal factors controlling or closely correlated with forest composition, (2) formulate a multidimensional gradient representation using these factors, and (3) reexamine forest composition and dynamics using this representation. It was also expected that this study might help place in perspective the extensive early research on Wisconsin forests and subsequent methodological advances in gradient analysis and ordination. Principal component analysis was used to represent compositional variation of southern Wisconsin forests. Analysis of environmental variation within the resultant ordination suggested two gradients to account for much of the variation observed. These were a moisture-nutrients gradient based on soil texture and a dynamics gradient based on tree size-class data. These gradients, reformulated, serve as axes in a two dimensional scheme of forest characterization. Within this characterization scheme, early successional forests on mesic to xeric sites respectively are dominated. by Quercus rubra, Quercus alba, Quercus macrocarpa, and Quercus velutina. On mesic sites succession proceeds through stands dominated by Ulmus rubra to dominance by Acer Saccharum. Dry-mesic stands appear to have dominance shared at climax by Q. alba, Carya ovata, and Prunus serotina. On extreme xeric sites. Q. macrocarpa and Q. velutina tend to form stable stands. Thus, the successional sequence becomes progressively shorter toward the xeric end of the moisture-nutrient gradient. The original continuum of Curtis and McIntosh was an abstract gradient implying no direct relationship to either site condition or successional status. Use of such factors in the present characterization allows a more precise conceptualization of functional relationships between forest types. In addition the methodology illustrates the complementary usage of mathematical ordination as an exploratory tool and gradient analysis as both a means of representing the relationships discovered and as a framework within which additional critical questions can be formulated and addressed.

Remeasurement of woody vegetation on permanent plots in western Great Smoky Mountains National Park indicated that understory composition and dominance have changed over the past two decades (between 1977-1979 and 1995-2000). We observed heavy mortality of Cornus Florida L., likely as a result of infection by Discula destructive Redlin, a destructive fungus that causes dogwood anthracnose. Mortality was highest in smaller size classes and seedling density generally decreased. Cove and alluvial forests, where heavy shading favors dogwood anthracnose, had the highest mortality. While still high, mortality in oak-hickory and oak-pine forests was lower than that of cove and alluvial forests. Corpus Florida density more than doubled on three plots located within an area that burned in 1976, likely as a result of sprouting and reduced shading in these fire-thinned stands. Over the same two decades, the importance of Tsuga canadensis (L.) Cart greatly increased in cove, alluvial, oak-hickory, and oak-pine stands. Changes in understory composition in conjunction with the widespread loss of C. florida may greatly impact numerous ecological relationships in these forests, including calcium availability, nutrient cycling, and food source availability for wildlife.

Adaptation to Sun and Shade: a Whole-Plant Perspective

    FUNCT PLANT BIOL

    Thomas J Givnish Thomas J Givnish

Re-evaluation of the classic study of acclimation of the photosynthetic light response in Atriplex, crucial to interpreting adaptation to irradiance in many traits, shows that it does not completely support the central dogma of adaptation to sun v. shade unless the results are analysed in terms of whole-plant energy capture. Calculations for Liriodendron show that the traditional light compensation point has little meaning for net carbon gain, and that the effective compensation point is profoundly influenced by the costs of night leaf respiration, leaf construction, and the construction of associated support and root tissue. Costs of support tissue are especially important, raising the effective compensation point by 140 μmol m-2s-1 in trees 1 m tall, and by nearly 1350 μmol m-2s-1 in trees 30 m tall. Effective compensation points give maximum tree heights as a function of irradiance, and shade tolerance as a function of tree height; calculations of maximum permissible height in Liriodendron correspond roughly with the height of the tallest known individual. New models for the evolution of canopy width/height ratio in response to irradiance and coverage within a tree stratum, and for the evolution of mottled leaves as a defensive measure in understory herbs, are outlined. -from Author

La presente propuesta de investigación constituye el primer esfuerzo en Panamá y Centroamérica para el desarrollo de marcadores de DNA ambiental de especies invasoras (plantas y animales) y el uso de estos marcadores en la detección de especies (con diferentes historias de invasión, éxito invasivo e historia natural) que habitan ambientes acuáticos tropicales en la República de Panamá (por ejemplo: tilapia, sargento y dos especies de plantas acuáticas). En adición, la presente propuesta de investigación contribuirá a determinar la relación entre la diversidad genética de las especies invasoras analizadas y éxito invasivo lo cual es un tema de debate entre la comunidad científica. Con la implementación de este proyecto podremos valorar el efecto de la densidad in situ y en acuarios en la probabilidad de detección del DNA ambiental y contribuir a generar la primera base de datos genéticos para especies invasoras en Centroamérica y el Caribe. Nuestro proyecto es innovador en la aplicación de herramientas moleculares de punta para la detección y manejo de especies exóticas, poniendo a nuestro país a tono con iniciativas globales. Además, el desarrollo de esta investigación tendrá una impacto positivo en el fortalecimiento de las capacidades nacionales mediante el entrenamiento de estudiantes universitarios y la creación de sinergias interinstitucionales con pertinencia en la problemática de especies exóticas invasivas como lo es el Canal de Panamá y que se beneficiarán de la inversión en ciencia y tecnología para la solución de problemas nacionales y globales. ...

Composition of lipids from the First Lusatian lignite seam of the Konin Basin (Poland): Relationship...

Samples of detrital lignite have been collected for detailed organic geochemical and carbon isotope analyses from the First Lusatian lignite seam at the Adamów, Jóźwin IIB and Tomisławice opencast mines, deposited after the last peak of the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. Carbon isotopic compositions of biomarkers from Polish lignite are reported for the first time. The aim of the study is to ... [Show full abstract] improve the chemotaxonomic value of biomarkers by relating the results to existing paleobotanical data, and to gain information about the influencing factors on δ13C of lignite and lipids. Furthermore, biomarker and isotopic proxies are tested for their applicability in paleoclimate studies. The molecular composition of the extracted lipids is highly variable, including leaf-wax n-alkanes in the C23 to C31 range, diterpenoids, hopanoids, and angiosperm-derived triterpenoids, as well as saturated fatty acids, long-chain n-alkanols and n-alkan-2-ones. The relative abundances of mid-chain (C23, C25) n-alkanes and their 1–2‰ higher δ13C values compared to long-chain n-alkanes (C29, C31) argue for a minor contribution of macrophytes (graminoids, etc.) to peat formation, enhanced during periods of raised water level. The presence of ferruginol and dehydroferruginol testifies the contribution of Taxodiaceae. The abundances of pimarane-type diterpenoids and the presence of non-aromatic abietane-derivatives argue for the contribution of Pinaceae. Based on the presence of lupeol and lupane-type triterpenoids, an input of Betulaceae can be concluded. The contribution of further angiosperms cannot be specified based on the composition of pentacyclic triterpenoids. However, the results indicate mixed vegetation, and are in agreement with paleobotanical data highlighting abundant conifers of the Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae and Pinaceae families, as well as angiosperms of various families (e.g., Nyssa, Quercus, Fagus), including Betulaceae (e.g., Alnus, Betula, Corylus). Based on the relationship between the carbon preference index of n-alkanes and mean annual air temperatures, obtained from a global database of peatlands, an average temperature of 24.5 °C is obtained. This value is significantly higher as estimated from paleobotanical data (15.7–19.7 °C), probably due to the influence of changes in vegetation on carbon preference index. The relative abundances of diterpenoids versus di- plus angiosperm-derived triterpenoids in detrital lignite samples revealed variable contributions of gymnosperms and angiosperms during the middle Miocene. Consistent with these results, a positive relationship exists between the di-/(di- + tri-) terpenoid biomarker ratios and δ13C of lignite samples, indicating the dominating role of varying gymnosperm/angiosperm contributions on the carbon isotopic composition of lignite. The C-isotope data of long-chain n-alkanes, diterpenoids, and angiosperm-derived triterpenoids co-vary within the profiles, arguing for an overall control of changes in δ13C of atmospheric CO2 on δ13C of plant lipids. Fluctuations in δ13C of individual compounds may also be related to changes in carbon cycling within the peat, humidity and air temperature. The influence of local variations in ambient CO2 (e.g., the canopy effect) cannot be excluded.

Azerbaijan is a country with low forest cover, only 11.8% of the territory is covered with forests. All forests perform important water-soil-protection functions. In forests, naturally grow 107species of trees and 328 shrubs species. Despite the fact that there are many species in dendroflora, only 10 tree species have economic value for the forest sector of the country. Beech (31.68%), oak ... [Show full abstract] (27.40%) and hornbeam (26.01%) are growing in 85.09% of forested areas. Beech forests are spread on 327 thousand hectares from 989,5 of total forest lands of he Republic. Beech forests are a source of high-quality wood and beech nuts. All beech forests grow in mountains at heights of 600-800 and 1600-1800 m above the sea level and performing important ecological functions. Until recently there were no problems with natural renewal of the beech forests, but now the regeneration of beech forests is alarming. In recent years, the productivity and density of beech forests decreased substantially, the natural regeneration proceeds unsatisfactorily and, consequently, reduction of beech forests takes place. We have researched 33,8 thousand hectares of beech forests of the Lesser Caucasus, their natural regeneration and made analysis of age structure of forests.

Asholt Wood, near Folkstone in Kent, is closer to the Foret Dominiale de Guines, south of Calais in France, than to the woods in north-east Kent around Rochester and Dartford. Asholt is also ecologically closer to Guines, for both are broadly pedunculate oak-ash woodlands (Plaisance, 1963), whereas the Rochester Bridge Woods and Darenth Wood contain much hornbeam, chestnut and sessile oak. These ...
