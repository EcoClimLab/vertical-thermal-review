Abstract
Understanding the factors that determine the distributions of understory plants is important because they represent the largest component of temperate forest diversity. In the present study, we investigate the influence of topographic gradients and overstory structure on composition and abundance of understory shrub species in Massís de l’Orri (central Pyrenees, Lleida, Spain). We established 329 plots in two opposing hills in the massif at elevations ranging from 1500 to 2200 m, where we measured understory composition, overstory structure and physiographic features. Overall richness and diversity did not vary with aspect and showed only a small decrease with elevation. However, understory composition showed drastic changes related to elevation and aspect. Most species had differences between slopes, some of them showing higher cover in south-facing plots and the others in north-facing plots. Elevation also influenced percent cover of many understory shrub species, which showed either a decrease (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Rosa sp.), a maximum at intermediate values (Cytisus purgans) or an increase (Rhododendron ferrugineum) with elevation. The effect of the two variables was not independent, and percent cover of the different species depended on the overall effect of aspect and elevation. The species with highest occurrence in plots, Vaccinium myrtillus, increased with elevation in south-facing slopes but showed similar values in north-facing slopes. Compared to topographic variables, the effect of overstory variables on understory was considerably smaller. Understory species richness and diversity were inversely but weakly correlated with overstory cover but not with basal area. These overstory variables only affected negatively the presence of C. purgans and Juniperus communis, two shade-intolerant species that decrease their abundance when light decreases. Overall, the results obtained suggest that topographic variables have a stronger influence on understory composition than overstory structure in the study area, which is located in the southern distribution limit of temperate forests in Europe.

... When LAI is not available, the stand density and the diameter of the trees can be used as a proxy of canopy closure. Additional factors, such as topography ( Gracia et al. 2007 ), soil characteristics, competition between the understory species for water and nutrients, might also interfere in the development and structure of the understory vegetation. The evaluation of the overstory cover effect on the understory vegetation has been stated for different forest systems. ...

(2007) found that overstory cover and basal area in temperate forests in NE Spain negatively affected the presence of two shade-intolerant shrub species, decreasing their abundance when light decreases. A significant relationship between stand cover on understory vegetation has been reported also by Coll et al. (2011), referring to some species of the Pinaceae and Fagaceae families in forests of Catalonia (Spain), and by Botequim et al. (2015) in Portuguese forests of different cover types. ...
... Our results showed a significant effect of stand density on understory cover in maritime pine stands, in accordance with the empirical statement and in line with the expectations. The "regulating" effect of overstory density on understory has been reported for other forest systems ( Bailey & Tappeiner 1998, McKenzie et al. 2000 , Gracia et al. 2007 , Coll et al. 2011, Botequim et al. 2015). Results are also in agreement with the expected dynamics of development of these ecosystems. ...

The aim of this study was to provide optimal silvicultural guidelines for the maintenance of low understory vegetation cover in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) stands in Mediterranean areas prone to the occurrence of forest fires. An extensive data set from maritime pine stands of northern Portugal was used to assess the effect of stand density on the understory cover. A statistically significant relationship between the spacing-top height factor (Fw) and the understory cover was found. An ecologically-based density regulation model was developed based on Fw = 0.21, which provided the optimal stand density and canopy cover to prevent the understory growth and proliferation, thereby reducing the vulnerability to forest fire and ensuring at the same time the highest values of stand yield. The developed model represents a supporting tool for density regulation of maritime pine stands in areas prone to forest fires. The representativeness of the supporting data set (in terms of number of sample plots and variability of the stands characteristics) provides confidence in the generalization of our results to different maritime pine stands in the Mediterranean area. This study suggests that managing stand density may be an effective adaptive management procedure which can help reducing the forest fire hazard.

... As the hydrothermal condition indicates energy, we analyzed that there may be a range of saturation in the use of energy by tree layer along the latitudinal gradient before the trees with higher energy requirements formed or entered, which may indicate a redundancy of energy [11,88], as occurs with light saturation in canopy photosynthesis [89]. When the canopy reached energy saturation, it tended to benefit the dominance of thermophilic-photopic species and maintain more individuals so that excess energy could be absorbed to reduce the risk of extinction [70,[90] [91] [92]. Higher species evenness could weaken the light availability of the understory, and thus reduce shade-intolerant tree species [91,93]. ...

Higher species evenness could weaken the light availability of the understory, and thus reduce shade-intolerant tree species [91, 93]. These factors might influence the tree community development toward a simple species composition, as the mean tree richness of PTF was lower (Figures 3f and 4b). ...
... The tree diameter distribution, as one of the most commonly used indexes, has been widely used to predict forest structure [94]. Trees of different ages and sizes represented different ontogenesis and could form complex tree structure [95], thereby increasing the diversity [91] . Other studies found that the temporal changes in stand structure and plant composition in a forest ecosystem varied with the succession stage [96,97], and this change regulates the heterogeneity of light conditions through canopy closure [98,99] and edaphic features (e.g., the soil moisture content, pH, temperature, and nutrient availability) under the forest canopy [22,31,57,[100][101][102]. ...

Climate, topography, and tree structure have different effects on plant diversity that vary with spatial scale. In this study, we assessed the contribution of these drivers and how they affect the vascular plant richness of different functional groups in a temperate forest ecosystem in Northeast China. We investigated about 0.986 million plants from 3160 sites to quantify the impact of annual mean temperature, sunshine duration, annual precipitation, standard deviation of diameter at breast height, and forest type on richness of vascular plants (total species, tree, treelet, shrub, and herb, separately) using the gradient boosting model. The results show that annual mean temperature had the strongest impact on plant richness. The tree richness peaked at intermediate annual mean temperature and sunshine duration and increased with annual precipitation. The Shannon diversity index and Simpson dominance index increased with annual precipitation and standard deviation of diameter at breast height, decreased with sunshine duration, and peaked at intermediate annual mean temperature and forest type. The total richness and understory richness increased with annual mean temperature and standard deviation of diameter at breast height and peaked at intermediate sunshine duration and annual precipitation. A comprehensive mechanism was found to regulate the plant diversity in forest ecosystems. The relationship between tree richness and annual mean temperature with latitudinal effect could be affected by the differences in number and size of tree individuals, indicating that plant diversity varies with the utilization of energy. The force driving plant richness varied with the functional group due to the different environmental resource requirements and the life history strategies of plants layers.

Exclosures are established with the objective of rehabilitating degraded lands and restoring of woody vegetation. Various studies have been conducted to evaluate the success of exclosure on restoring woody species diversity. However, works focusing on the effect of topographic factors on woody species diversity are scarce. Understanding the factors that determine woody species diversity is important for management purposes. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effect of altitude, slope, and aspect as topographic variables on woody species diversity in Dawsura exclosure in northern Ethiopia. Data on species identity, abundance, slope, elevation and aspect were recorded from 58 sampling plots. Different diversity indices were used to analyze the data and one-way ANOVA and linear regression was conducted. There were a total of 34 woody species represented 15 families, of which 62% and 38% were trees and shrubs respectively. Altitude (r 2 ¼ 0.63, p ¼ 0.000 and r ¼ 0.794, p < 0.01) and slope (r 2 ¼ 0.57, p ¼ 0.002 and r ¼ 0.68, p < 0.01) correlated significantly and positively with Shannon diversity, whereas aspect (r 2 ¼ 0.12, p ¼ 0.378 and r ¼ 0.27, p > 0.05) did not correlate significantly with Shannon diversity. Woody species diversity at moderate (1.44) and high (1.85) altitudes was significantly different from that of low (0.86) altitude areas (p ¼ 0.0013). Furthermore, significantly higher woody species diversity was recorded at steep slope (1.88) and moderately steep slope (1.62) areas as compared to the gentle slope (0.95) areas. No significant variation was observed in woody species diversity among the aspect categories (p > 0.05). The study concludes that woody species diversity is largely regulated by slope and altitude than aspect in the exclosure. We suggest other environmental and anthropogenic variables should be taken into consideration in future studies on woody species diversity.

... According to the traditional niche-based approach, many authors have sought for species-environment relationships to understand the determinants of community composition (Svenning and Skov 2002). These studies commonly found a predominant effect of soil pH on plant diversity (i.e., richness and composition) (Brunet et al. 1997;Sagers and Lyon 1997;Diekmann et al. 1999;Augusto et al. 2003;Borchsenius et al. 2004;Schuster and Diekmann 2005;Lenière and Houle 2006), and also of slope aspect in forested landscapes with dissected topography (Cantlon 1953;Small and MacCarthy 2002; Gracia et al. 2007 ). These studies usually ignored the potential effect of spatial configuration on the observed patterns (but see de Blois et al. 2001). ...
... For each plot, we recorded the slope inclination (%) using an inclinometer and the slope aspect using a compass. The aspects were grouped into two categories as follows: ''north-facing'' (North, Northeast, Northwest, and one plot facing East; n = 42), corresponding to cool and wet climatic conditions and ''south-facing'' (South, Southeast and Southwest; n = 15), corresponding to warm and dry climatic conditions (Bratton 1975;Gonin 1993; Gracia et al. 2007 ). Two stands located in the valley had no aspect. ...
... The prevailing effect of soil pH on vegetation composition found here is in accordance with other forest studies (Brunet et al. 1997;Sagers and Lyon 1997;Augusto et al. 2003;Borchsenius et al. 2004;Schuster and Diekmann 2005;Lenière and Houle 2006). As is the case in other hilly landscapes, we also found a significant relationship between slope aspect (Cantlon 1953;Burnett et al. 1998; Gracia et al. 2007 ) and stand composition. Stand composition differences between slopes aspects decreased as the height of the layer investigated increased, as previously reported by Cantlon (1953). ...

The species-environment relationship for woody species may vary according to the forest layers considered. In fragmented forest stands, spatial configuration may also influence forest layer composition. We investigated the relationships between four forest layer compositions and environmental conditions, and spatial variables accounting for forest fragmentation, in 59 forest stands. Ground and shrub layer composition were mainly linked to environmental conditions, particularly to soil pH and slope aspect, while the upper layer compositions were principally correlated to the spatial configuration. The distance to the nearest forest edge was correlated with all the forest layer compositions. Our results suggest that woody species respond to factors acting at different spatial and temporal scales, depending on the forest layer they belong to. The species-environment relationship seems to weaken from the lower to upper layer, the upper layer being more closely linked to spatial configuration and probably to past management. This study underlines the importance of taking spatial configuration in addition to environmental conditions into account when studying woody plant diversity in stands located in fragmented forests. Moreover, stand history seems to have a lasting effect on woody plant composition, particularly for the tree layer.

... The stand dynamics of oak forests in Europe has been a topic of interest and concern to resource managers and scientists in the last period. Many studies have examined the effects of tree decline on stand (especially on canopy layer) development but relatively few research papers deal with shrub community and shrub layer dynamics in the process of tree decline (Alaback and Herman 1988; Gracia et al. 2007; Gazol and Ibáñez 2009). ...
... The studies of shrub species performed have mostly focused on the static population structure (age and size structures) (Tappeiner et al. 1991;Stalter et al. 1997). Other studies have focused on the cover and diversity of shrubs (Kerns and Ohmann 2004; Gracia et al. 2007 ). The decreased oak tree density led to numerous significant structural changes in the understorey such as herbaceous layer and shrub layer. ...

(2007) the relationship between shrubs cover and basal area of overstory was only significant for two species, and in both two cases, cover decreased with basal area. Other studies have shown negative correlations of understory cover with canopy trees basal area (Gilliam and Turrill 1993) presumably because of differential light availability. ...

The serious oak decline was reported for the 1979-80 period and 63.0% of adult oaks died in a mixed oak forest in the Síkfőkút site, in the northeastern part of Hungary. The data were used to obtain (1) quantitative information on shrub canopy, including foliage cover percentage of the shrub layer, mean cover of shrub species in 2012; (2) structural information on shrub foliage arrangement and (3) true description from the present ecological condition of the subcanopy layer. In the monitoring plot, the foliage cover condition of specimens only above 8.0 m was observed in 2012. The data relating to the projected foliage areas of high shrubs have been evaluated and foliage map waas digitized in ArcGis. It was measured a very low value of the foliage cover. The shrub layer cover was 61.5%, the duplex-and multiplex was 13.1% and only 76.8% total foliage cover in the understorey. The mean cover of the shrub species changed between 0.5 m 2 and 6.4 m 2 in the high shrub layer. The maximum mean cover values were recorded by the dominant woody species (Acer campestre, Acer tataricum and Cornus mas) in the shrub community. The GIS analysis confirmed that total foliage cover of the subcanopy layer and of the higher dominant woody individuals was 522.4 m 2. Our results suggest that the foliage cover size of shrub layer was a very low in 2012 and was measured similar low mean cover values of shrub species.

... Some of the ecological factors which can affect biodiversity are elevation, aspect, slope, climate, and human activities (Ejtehadi et al. 2010). So far there are different kinds of studies that have been conducted in different territories, trying to predict or investigate diversity distribution related to topographic factors (Pourbabaee 1998;Marvie Mohajer 2005; Gracia et al. 2007; Ismailzadeh, Hosseini 2007;Ghanbari 2008;Saatchi et al. 2008;Kymasi 2012), edaphic (Qomioghli et al. 2006;Ejtehadi et al. 2010;Kymasi 2012) and climatic factors (Mehdinya et al. 2006;Parmentier 2011;Gixhari et al. 2012). One of the main purposes of modelling research is to clarify the most appropriate method, regarding the spatial prediction of forest characteristics, based on sampling methods (Kint et al. 2003). ...
... Moreover, due to the difficulties of human activities (selective cutting) at higher elevations these areas are closer to natural patterns (different frequency of species). Many studies like Peffer et al. (2003), Marvie Mohajer (2006), Gracia et al. (2007) , Guoyu (2011), Shirzad andTabari (2011), Kymasi (2012), and Momeni Moghaddam et al. (2012) have shown that elevation is the most important environmental factor affecting the spatial distribution of species. This conclusion is also verified in our study. ...

Biological diversity is the basis for a wide array of goods and services provided by forests. The variety of forest trees and shrubs plays a vital role in the daily life of forest communities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of modelling the diversity of tree species by characteristics of topography, soil and climate, using data mining algorithms k-NN, RF and SVM in Dr. Bahramnia forestry plan in the north of Iran. Based on the basal area factor for each species in a total of 518 sample plots, diversity indices such as species richness, evenness and heterogeneity were calculated for each plot. Topographic maps of primary and secondary properties were prepared using the digital elevation model. Categories of the soil and climate maps database of Dr. Bahramnia forestry plan were extracted. Modelling rates of tree and shrub species diversity using data mining algorithms, with 80% of the sampling plots were taken. Assessment of the model accuracy, using 20% of samples and evaluation criteria, was conducted. Results showed that topographic features, especially elevation, had the highest impact on the species diversity index. The modelling results also showed that Camargo evenness index had lowest root mean square error (RMSE) (0.14) and RMSE% (24.35), compared to other indicators of diversity. In addition, the results of the comparison between the algorithms showed that the random forest algorithms were more accurate in modelling the diversity.

In this study we examined the effect of stand, topographic, and climatic factors on the fuel complex characteristics of Aleppo (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and Calabrian (Pinus brutia Ten.) pine forests of Greece, based on measurements in fifty six (56) plots dominated by Aleppo pine (28 plots) and Calabrian pine (28 plots) in four different forest sites. The data were analyzed through Random Forest regression, linear regression, and quantile regression. The results showed that for all the examined factors, basal area, stand density index and stand height were the most important factors explaining fuel complex characteristics in the region for both species. Topography and climate factors were not found to be significant factors for canopy fuels. However, elevation and annual precipitation showed a minor effect mainly on the shrub fuel layer of Calabrian pine. The analysis and the conclusions of the study can be important inputs for forest management decisions (thinning, fuel treatments, stand regeneration planning) quantifying the effect that certain fuel management actions can have on the fuel hazard that the stands of these two important Mediterranean pines represent.

... Our findings highlight that shrub richness in the region is influenced by resource quantity in interaction with development stage. Temperature and aridity were common influences on shrub richness patterns, which is consistent with findings from other studies (Gracia et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2014b). Our findings diverge from the Canada-wide study of Zhang et al. (2014b) who found that poorly drained sites supported higher richness. ...
... Our results also suggest that many of the shrub species present in the region may be shade tolerant. Both Gracia et al. (2007) and Zellweger et al. (2015) attributed relationships between crown cover and richness in Spain and Switzerland, respectively, to shade tolerance. The relationship between increasing slope and richness could also be causing a feedback in stands with high conifer density by promoting light transmission into the understorey (Coop et al. 2010), thereby facilitating the presence of less shade tolerant species and thus promoting increased richness. ...

The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) is regarded as an appropriate model for understanding plant diversity–disturbance relationships in the boreal region. However, concern has been raised over its applicability across such a broad region, in particular, in low productive areas of the region such as the cold, dry region of the southwest Yukon. We examined plant richness and diversity in relation to the IDH in the context of both disturbance and productivity gradients. We then tested whether environmental variation and resource quantity interacted with development stage to shape richness patterns in the region. We found that richness and diversity did not conform to the IDH but that environmental variation and resource quantity influenced richness and diversity patterns. Overall richness and diversity patterns were not influenced by development stage though plant functional group patterns were. Richness patterns varied between plant functional groups suggesting that divergent processes shape inter functional group richness within the same stands. Our findings highlight the influence of multiple factors governing patterns of plant richness and diversity in the cold dry boreal forests of the southwest Yukon.

... In mountain ecosystems, topographic conditions can influence resource and moisture availability, and daily insolation, which are important factors for species distribution, plant growth and mortality patterns. Therefore, sites with different topographical features support different forest types (Small & McCarthy 2002 , Garcia et al. 2007 . ...
... Indeed, long-lived oriental beech trees can reach more than 2 meters in diameter at productive sites, and show a high amount of forest dead wood in the studied sites (Sefidi & Etemad 2012, Moradi et al. 2012.

In the Caspian region, the most productive sites are located on the northern slopes. ...

There is an emerging interest in the relationships between forest structure and topographic aspects. Still, such patterns have been scarcely studied in undisturbed mixed beech forests in northern Iran. We investigated the influence of topographical factors including aspect, slope degree, and landform index (LI) on the distribution of dominant tree species and coarse woody debris (CWD). Tree density and basal area were not significantly correlated with any of the measured parameters, except a moderate relation between basal area and LI (r =-0.376; P = 0.029). Redundancy analysis (RDA) of the tree layer revealed a significant relationship between the measured environmental variables and species distributions. CWD volume showed significant negative correlation with percent canopy coverage and was highly correlated with slope. Density of CWD in decay class IV was significantly correlated with aspect and percent of canopy cover. Analyses of CWD distributions in relation to both living vegetation and topographic gradients showed a highly complex interplay of factors driving the distribution of CWD across the forest stands.

Mountain areas are particularly sensitive to climate change. Species distribution models predict important extinctions in these areas whose magnitude will depend on a number of different factors. Here we examine the possible impact of climate change on the Rhododendron ferrugineum (alpenrose) niche in Andorra (Pyrenees). This species currently occupies 14.6 km2 of this country and relies on the protection afforded by snow cover in winter. We used high-resolution climatic data, potential snow accumulation and a combined forecasting method to obtain the realized niche model of this species. Subsequently, we used data from the high-resolution Scampei project climate change projection for the A2, A1B and B1 scenarios to model its future realized niche model. The modelization performed well when predicting the species's distribution, which improved when we considered the potential snow accumulation, the most important variable influencing its distribution. We thus obtained a potential extent of about 70.7 km2 or 15.1% of the country. We observed an elevation lag distribution between the current and potential distribution of the species, probably due to its slow colonization rate and the small-scale survey of seedlings. Under the three climatic scenarios, the realized niche model of the species will be reduced by 37.9-70.1 km2 by the end of the century and it will become confined to what are today screes and rocky hillside habitats. The particular effects of climate change on seedling establishment, as well as on the species' plasticity and sensitivity in the event of a reduction of the snow cover, could worsen these predictions.

Current understanding of ecological consequences of grassland afforestation includes plot-scale changes in plant diversity and richness, community structure and composition, soil physical and chemical properties, aboveground biomass, and microbial community structure (Jobbágy and Jackson 2003, Farley et al. 2004, Alrababah et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008, Wei et al. 2009, Berthrong et al. 2012, Hewitt et al. 2012. Different studies have demonstrated that stand-associated environmental conditions (i.e., stand structural properties, edaphic characteristics, and the physical and chemical features of the litter layer), disturbance regime and management, and other spatial attributes affect local species diversity (Gracia et al. 2007 , Barbier et al. 2008, Tárrega et al. 2011, Zhang et al. 2013, Kern et al. 2014, Dimov et al. 2015.

Forest plantations play an important role in ecological restoration and economic development in China. To promote conservation of biodiversity and sustainable forest development, analysis of the dynamics of plant species diversity is necessary to guide management strategies. The objectives of this study were to investigate changes in herbaceous community composition, diversity, distribution, and aboveground biomass with age of planted Picea crassifolia stands on two slopes and to determine environmental factors responsible for such changes. Fifty-three species from 22 families and 38 genera were collected along a grassland-afforestation successional gradient during a comprehensive vegetation survey in 2014. The herbaceous community was dominated by species in the Gramineae, followed by the Leguminosae, Compositae, and Rosaceae. Our results showed that afforestation significantly affected community and habitat characteristics. Further, afforestation decreased aboveground biomass and percent cover and increased plant diversity of the herbaceous community. Increasing duration of afforestation was generally associated with lower soil bulk density and pH and with greater soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Significant differences ( P < 0.05) were observed 33 and 45 years after afforestation. Understory composition differed considerably among the different-aged forest stands, and 89.3٪ of the variance was explained by the measured environmental variables. The differences in soil properties and in the diversity and aboveground biomass of the herbaceous community between afforested and nonafforested grasslands indicated that afforestation provided a “nurse-tree” function for local plant diversity and had a substantial potential to increase soil organic carbon and nitrogen storage.

Aims Species composition and diversity of the mountainous rangelands are results of interactions between environmental severities, heterogeneous topography and facilitative effects by nurse plants. This research was aimed to compare relative effects of these three environmental variables on the natural vegetation of a mountainous rangeland. For a more detailed understanding; effects of four different nurse species were separately compared on the various plant growth forms and on two community plant responses (diversity and abundance). Methods A mountainous semiarid rangeland was selected in Baharkish, Quchan, Northeast of Iran. Density and canopy cover of all plant species were recorded under the canopy of four different shrubs and in open areas, in north and south-facing aspects, and in a normal and a drought year. Shannon diversity, total abundance (% cover) and the abundance of different growth forms were used as criteria for assessing effects of the environmental variables. Data were arranged in a factorial combination, and analyzed by 3-way ANOVA using a GLM analysis. Important Findings (1) Drought, aspect and canopy created niche differentiation: Annual forbs and shrubs were more affected by drought, whereas geophytes and grasses were more responsive to slope aspects. Effects of drought and slope aspect were more profound on species diversity, whereas that of canopy facilitation was stronger on plant abundance. (2) Canopy facilitation was dependent on severity of the abiotic factors and life history of interacting species. Canopy facilitation allowed for the persistence of only annual forbs, but it was disadvantaged during the drought year. Plant community responses to abiotic factors (slope and drought) were more dependent on the plant growth form, while responses to canopy facilitation were more dependent on the morphology and/or ecology of nurse shrubs. (3) Effect of shrubs was dependent on their morphology and ecology: Shrubs with larger canopy area and nitrogen fixation capability increased, but those with allelopathic effects or a dense canopy structure decreased the diversity of the understory species.

... In addition, there was a significant interaction effect between stand age and topographic position on understory species richness, showing understory richness would increase along with stand age at the north-facing slope. Different topographic positions create different levels of light availability and soil moisture on the forest floor, and then affect understory cover, richness, and composition (Gracia et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2017). In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes receive a greater amount of solar radiation, resulting in a relatively warmer and drier microclimate (Warren, 2008). ...
... This potentially benefits shade-intolerant species with high light requirements (Kumar et al., 2017). At flat locations and north-facing slopes, the understory is mainly composed of shade-tolerant and mesic-loving species (Gracia et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2017). Thus, the different tolerance levels possessed by plants for light and moisture availability may determine their presence or absence in habitats with different topography. ...

Soil resource quantity and heterogeneity as well as overstory characteristics change along with stand age after fire disturbance, imposing strong influences on post-fire understory recovery. In this study, we aimed to assess how soil resource (nitrogen quantity and heterogeneity), topographic position (aspect), overstory characteristics (basal area), and stand age affected understory characteristics (cover, richness, evenness, and composition) during boreal forest succession after fire disturbance. We collected plant community and environmental data from 76 stands aged at 4 to 203 years post-fire in the boreal forest of Northeast China. We separately tested the effects of the considered factors on the characteristics of total understory, shrubs, and herbs. Total understory cover was higher at the south-facing slopes and flat locations than at north-facing slopes. Species richness of total understory, shrubs, and herbs was higher at the flat locations and south-facing slopes than at the north-facing slopes. The cover of total understory and shrubs showed increasing trends along with stand age, soil nitrogen quantity, and overstory basal area as well as decreasing trends along with soil nitrogen heterogeneity, while the cover of herbs showed reversed trends across all the three topographic positions. Understory richness showed decreasing trends along with soil nitrogen quantity as well as increasing trends along with soil nitrogen heterogeneity and overstory basal area. Total understory evenness showed flat trends along with soil nitrogen quantity, heterogeneity, and stand age as well as decreasing trends along with overstory basal area. Understory community composition was mainly affected by topographic position, stand age, and overstory basal area. During understory recovery, community composition shifted from shade-intolerant species to shade-tolerant species. Our results highlight the importance of topography and stand age in post-fire understory recovery in boreal forests of China, mediated through availability of light and soil nutrients.

Understanding how the planting of non-native species impacts native vegetation is of most importance for forest management, as introduced species may alter environmental conditions with respect to soil composition, light intensity, and species composition. Here, we compared the stand structure, understory vegetation and site properties of a natural Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) as the second tree layer. We recorded saplings and species and their abundance in the understory vegetation, the thicknesses of organic (O) and humus (A) soil layers, soil pH and light indexes in nine Scots pine stands with a second tree layer of beech and in nine control pine stands with a second tree layer of spruce. An ordination method was used to analyze all the data together and ANOVA to determine whether there were differences between stands. We found that species diversity in pine stands with planted beech as the second layer was lower than in pine stands with spruce as the second layer. In pine stands with beech as the second tree layer, shrub, herb and moss cover was significantly lower, and the soil humus layer and organic soil layer were thicker and thinner, respectively. Stand parameters such as mean volume and mean annual increment of the second tree layer were significantly higher in pine stands with planted beech as the second tree layer than in pine stand with spruce as the second tree layer. The mean volume and the mean annual increment of the first tree layer dominated by Scots pine did not differ significantly between stands with planted beech and those with natural spruce. Scots pine stands with a beech second layer had negative effects on understory species richness and abundance. This effect was most likely due to the lower light transmittance and poor physical properties of the forest-floor litter in the Scots pine stands with planted beech.

Khojir national park is one of the oldest protected areas in Iran that is greatly considerable in terms ot biodiversity and ecological values. Pistachio (Pistacia atlantica Desf.) communities, which create some woodland in this park, are unique because they grow tolerantly in a dry land, in the vicinity of Tehran capital. This research is about some ecological properties of Pistachio woodlands. The dominant community of the area is Pistacia-Amygdalus lycioides. The density of Pistacia is 86 per hectare. The density of Pistachio trees was greater in the higher elevation than in the lower one. In addition, the collai diameter and the height of trees in the higher class were less. The average density of Pistacia in plots in northern slopes was significantly more than southern slopes (at 5% level), but the average collar diameter of them were more on the southern aspect. The distribution, diameter and height of pistachio trees were not significantly related to the percentage of slope. Among the soil variables, the saturated water percentage (SP), N (total nitrogen) and texture of soil were effective factors which played significant role in ordination of plots containing pistachio. Considering the important role of P. atlantica forest stands in soil and water conservation in Iran, we should attach more importance to their protection and conservation, as well as activities such as road and dam construction, and garden establishment in such unique ecosystems.

... These land-use changes, together with extensive reforestation programmes, have triggered extended encroachment and densification processes in forests, mainly pinewoods (Am eztegui et al. 2010;Navarro & Pereira 2012). More recently, the activity of seed dispersers like jays or mice (G omez 2003), and the increasing cover of facilitating shrubs in the understorey of pine forestsfavoured by the sharp decrease in livestock grazing pressureare enabling a gradual entry of late successional broad-leaved species in their understorey (Gracia et al. 2007; Martin-Alcon et al. 2012), enhancing natural processes of tree species diversification (G omez 2003;G omez-Aparicio et al. 2005;Navarro-Gonz alez et al. 2013;Mart ın-Alc on et al. 2015b).

How do thermal migration distance and extreme cold events affect seedling emergence and survival in assisted migration schemes in the sub-Mediterranean context? What role does plant provenance play? Can biotic interactions such as nurse effect of the overstorey and shrub layer buffer the negative responses to plant translocation? Are any of these effects species-specific? Three pinewoods in the Catalan Pre-Pyrenees, northeast Iberian Peninsula. We used a replicated field trial to test the early years establishment of two contrasted provenances of four Quercus species (Q. coccifera, Q. ilex, Q. faginea and Q. pubescens) that were sown and planted along gradients of elevation and understorey microsite conditions in sub-Mediterranean pinewoods. Seedling responses to translocation were evaluated through seedling emergence, seedling survival and re-sprouting after dieback events according to seedling provenance, thermal migration distance, extreme cold events and microenvironment. The study reports high success of both the planting (with an overall 76.3% of initial 3-yr survival) and sowing (with an overall 50% of seedling emergence) experiments. The results show that: (1) the thermal migration distance and the occurrence of extreme cold events have strong effects on the responses of the translocated species (particularly the evergreen oaks); (2) the forest overstorey plays an important role in attenuating the negative effects of thermal migration distance on seedling survival; and (3) these responses are species-specific. The evergreen Quercus species showed more evidence of high ecotypic differentiation in terms of cold tolerance, enabling local provenances to respond better to translocation. In contrast, marcescent species, showed high phenotypic plasticity that led to a better overall establishment success. The implementation of assisted migration is a feasible option to increase the diversity and resilience of the sub-Mediterranean pinewoods. Assisted migration programmes should manage risks by thoroughly considering thermal migration distances and the occurrence of extreme cold events when selecting species and seed sources, since Mediterranean tree species show different strategies regarding adaptation to cold. Programme managers should also consider the advantage of planting/sowing under relatively closed canopy to buffer some of the negative responses associated with translocation.

Aim of study: This study aimed to determine the influence of topography and stand-structure on the characteristics of shrub communities and tree regeneration in a Mediterranean forest. Area of study: The Navahondona forest in Cazorla mountain range (SE Spain). Material and Methods: Data from 298 inventory plots were analysed by means of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to test the effects of aspect, altitude and stand basal area on shrub cover and diversity. Likewise, the effects of these three factors plus shrub cover on the recruitment of Spanish black pine (Pinus nigra spp. salzmannii) and two oak species (Quercus ilex and Q. faginea) were analysed by GLMs. Additionally, the influence of topography and forest structure on the specific distribution of shrub species was analysed with multivariate methods. Main results: Shrub cover and diversity were generally low and did not change across the topographic gradient. Tree density was the only study variable affecting (negatively) shrub cover. However, shrub composition changed with aspect and altitude. Both pine and oak regeneration benefited from partial tree cover at intermediate values of stand density, but only oak regeneration was facilitated by shrubs. Research highlights: Altitude, aspect and stand basal area influence the characteristics of shrub communities and tree regeneration. Proactive management of dense pinewoods might be needed to increase shrub and tree diversity.

The biodiversity of forest stands should be analysed from the point of view of not only compositional elements but also structural diversity. The main objective of this study was to compare tree diameter structural diversity of the mixed managed and unmanaged stands with Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica. There were 62 study plots established in the Carpathians (Southern Poland) and in the wie ˛tokrzyskie Mountains (Central Poland) in managed and unmanaged stands. The comparison of the studied stands involved the identification and modelling of size structures, the use of the Gini coefficient and the relative distribution method (including entropy and po-larisation). Six structural types were distinguished: three unimodals of a different width of diameter at breast height (DBH) range (mainly for the managed stands), reverse-J, rotated-sigmoid and bimodal (for unmanaged stands). Modelling of the distinguished structural types by means of theoretical distributions has shown that the best results of approximation for unimodal skewed and reverse-J DBH distributions were obtained with the single Weibull and gamma distribution, while in the case of rotated-sig-moid and bimodal DBH distributions the best results were obtained with mixture models. The comparisons have shown that tree diameter structural diversity was more complex in unmanaged forests compared to managed stands. For managed stands the Gini coefficient assumed values from 0.31 to 0.48, while in the case of the unman-aged forests, from 0.33 to 0.73. One should aim to increase tree diameter structural diversity in managed forests, adopting the close-to-nature silviculture concept which consists of imitating natural processes.

This study investigates forest understory plant diversity and composition in managed and unmanaged stands within the context of a long-term silvicultural experiment in the Acadian Forest of Maine. I examined the effects of silvicultural intensity and past land use on understory plant species diversity and composition. Silvicultural treatments include three variants of the selection system, three variants of the shelterwood system, modified and fixed diameter-limit cutting, and an unregulated harvest. Two types of unmanaged stands were studied: a continuously forested natural area and secondary forest stands on old fields. Chapter 1 presents analysis of understory plant diversity and composition in managed and unmanaged stands; patterns were examined in relation to site history, current management or use, and environmental factors such as overstory composition, basal area, canopy openness, and soil drainage. A total of 234 species were found in 317 plots. The old field stands had a richer and more diverse understory than all other treatments. In continuously forested managed and unmanaged treatments, understory species richness and diversity generally declined with decreasing silvicultural intensity. Stands without an agricultural history were more similar in understory composition than old field stands. Differences in diversity and composition of understory plants appear to be related to canopy composition and forest floor disturbance. Old field stands were characterized by an overstory dominated by hardwoods and had greater mineral soil cover, while all other treatments were conifer-dominated and had greater basal area and more softwood litter cover. Softwood basal area was the best predictor of understory species diversity and richness in the continuously forested areas of the PEF. All continuously forested stands, including those treated with silviculture, were composed of native forest plant species typical of the Acadian Forest, though plots in the natural area and unregulated harvest treatment included a few normative invasive plant seedlings. The understory composition of the old fields contained 13 normative species, nine normative invasive species, and a greater component of early successional ruderals than the continuously forested stands. While silvicultural treatments are associated with understory plant compositional changes, these differences are slight in comparison to the effects of an agricultural past. Continued monitoring of the understory vegetation is needed to understand the short- and long-term responses of understory plant populations to silvicultural treatment. In Chapter 2, I further explore the pattern of normative invasive plant abundance and distribution on the PEF. Multivariate ordination of data from the old field stands revealed positive associations between invasive plants and exposed mineral soil and percent hardwood basal area. Spearman correlation analysis indicated the percent cover of invasive plants was negatively correlated with distance from a roadside, hardwood litter cover, and organic horizon thickness. Glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus) was the most frequent invasive species in the old field stands, and its distribution was not correlated with any of the observed environmental variables. An investigation of invasive plant occurrences in the silvicultural experiment area of the PEF assessed invasive plant encroachment. Meander surveys revealed that invasive plants were infrequent and were most often found close to woods roads and trails. Frangula alnus was the most frequent invasive plant in the silvicultural experiment area. The majority of invasive plant occurrences were in two locations: one replicate of the unregulated harvest and the natural area. These two areas are in close proximity to large invasive seed sources, and both areas have a greater degree of recreational or silvicultural disturbance, which is associated with invasive plant presence. Monitoring of the normative invasive plants will yield needed information about their patterns of establishment in a conifer-dominated Acadian Forest. The prevalence of invasive species in the old fields warrants immediate action to prevent their spread into the managed areas of the PEF. An invasive species management plan should be implemented to protect the integrity of the long-term experiment and biodiversity at the PEF. A successful and cost-effective control strategy can only occur if applied while invasive plant populations are still small and sparse.

... Abundant shrub cover is common in forests of Mediterranean climates, and shrub cover in the present study, with mean 10% (east side) to 30%(west side), exemplified this trend. The proportion of understory cover contributed by grasses relative to shrubs typically increases as environmental conditions become more demanding, e.g., drier, more exposed, or at higher elevation (Abella and Covington, 2004; Gracia et al., 2007; Coll, 2011), and our study area displayed this trend from west to east. Although forest treatments led to increased cover of graminoid(east and west sides) and forb (west side only) lifeforms, the increases were small compared to those seen in other manipulative studies in mixed-conifer forest. ...

The Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act of 1999was in the vanguard of large national forest management projects in the Sierra Nevada aimed at protecting forests from wildfire. Detailed monitoring was done because of the newness and large spatial extent of the management treatments which included thinning small- and medium-diameter trees, group selection, and prescribed underburning. Response variables were measured before, one year after, and five years after treatment on 64 units and comprised of tree canopy cover and basal area, snag density, down dead wood weight, cover of shrubs and herbs, and simulated fire behavior. Data were analyzed with generalized linear mixed statistical models based on negative binomial or normal distributions. Rate of attainment of predetermined target objectives was evaluated for several of the response variables. Treatments led to significant decreases in canopy cover and basal area; mean canopy cover decreased from 48% to 33% after treatment and remained essentially unchanged for the subsequent four years. Treatments successfully avoided harvesting or otherwise damaging large (≥ 30 inches dbh) trees. The density of large snags (≥15 inches DBH) was halved by treatments, but at five years after treatment the proportion of stands in compliance with retention guidelines (25%) was no different than before treatment. Large log loads also declined by half after treatment but unlike snags showed no indication of recovery; compliance with retention objectives was only 11% at five years after treatment. Understory plant forage species were either resilient to treatments (shrubs) or responded with increased growth [forbs (east side only) and grasses].Fire simulations showed that diminishing the probability of crown fire, a major goal of the treatments, was achievedin large part; the number 3 of stands with predicted active or conditional crown fire behavior was reduced between 55% and 74% (97thand 90thpercentile weather conditions, respectively). Treatments generally met the primary goal of improving forest health and resilience to wildfire but had mixed success in meeting secondary objectives related to maintenance of habitat quality. Given the ever-increasing threat of high-severity wildfire, the treatments may be judged as having met their overarching goal.

Structural changes in the shrub layer were analysed in a Hungarian oak forest after the oak decline pandemics. This paper focuses on the following questions: (1) which of the woody species tolerated better the forest conditions after oak decline? (2) What are the ecological factors that explain the successful response of woody species to changes in light and thermal conditions? In the monitoring plot, the structural condition of specimens only above 8.0 m was observed. After the appearance of oak decline some Acer campestre, Cornus mas and Acer tataricum specimens appeared that reached between 8.0-13.0 m in height. Significant differences were revealed between top canopy density and foliage cover of the subcanopy and between top canopy density and mean cover of field maple. The findings of the study indicate that the forest responded to oak decline with significant structural rearrangement in the shrub layer and that three woody species compensated for the remarkable foliage loss in the top canopy. These species formed a second crown layer directly below the canopy formed by oaks.

Understory vegetation is an important component in most forest ecosystems. It is very important for soil and water conservation in karst region, study on understory will provide valuable information for understanding the interaction mechanism between understory flora and karst environment. Thirty-two plots were sampled in three vegetation types along with a restoration gradient (shrubland, forest–shrub transition, and mixed-species broadleaf forest) in typical karst mountains in Southwest Guangxi, China. Overstory trees, understory vascular plants, soil nutrients, and topographic factors were recorded in each 400-m² plot. Multivariate statistics were used, including the multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP), indicator species analysis, and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). MRPP showed understory species composition significantly differed among the three vegetation types, with the greatest difference between the shrubland and the mixed forest. Twenty-one understory species were identified as significant indicator species, with 13 species being identified as indicators of the shrubland, two of forest–shrub transition, and six of the mixed forest. Light-demanding herbaceous seed plants were common in shrubland, while shade-tolerant calcicole assembled under the mixed forest. Forward selection of CCA ordination revealed that understory plant distribution was most strongly influenced by elevation, followed by soil pH, the concentration of total potassium and exchangeable calcium, slope aspect, slope degree, and the concentration of available potassium. The result reveals that vegetation types affect understory species composition by modifying understory environments. Elevation affects the spatial distribution of vegetation and soil factors, and then the understory plants. Meanwhile, soil Ca content also plays a key role in the understory species distribution. Understory diversity increased with increasing canopy structure complexity from shrubland to mixed-species forest. Thus, it is necessary to take measures to promote natural vegetation restoration and to protect the mixed forests in degraded karst areas.

For this reason and given its large occurrence above the treeline in the Alps and Pyrenees (Francon et al., 2017; Gracia et al., 2007) , we believe that this species represents a valuable dendroecological indicator to document the response of alpine vegetation to global warming over the last centuries. As such, R. ferrugineum could be used easily to complement Juniperus nana in future dendroecological studies, even more so as both species are characterized by a wide distribution above treeline and a life span of more than a century (Carrer et al., 2019;Pellizzari et al., 2014Pellizzari et al., , 2016). ...

The present study was aimed to study the impact of human settlements on forests of Karen valley in Kashmir Himalayas. Forest composition, community structure and diversity patterns are important ecological attributes significantly correlated with prevailing environmental as well as anthropogenic variables.The conversion of forest land for agriculture practices, grazing and pastures in the settlements has been especially accentuated in traditional settlements. Rapid rate of deforestation and disturbed patterns were indicated by a stem/stump ratio of 1.7. The density was low at the HD site with a tree density of 180ha-1. Human population is much dependent on forest resources for fuel and timber requirements. Due to poor socio-economic status, climatic severity and absence of alternate energy resources people are forced to rely on local forests resources. Our study revealed that the deforestation spreads faster near the human settlements and have a direct impact on the forest ecosystem. The results of present study may provide a baseline information for formulating conservation and management strategies for these and other adjoining forests.

Shrub layer diversity is an essential component of the forest ecosystem diversity, that contributes significantly to structuring the community and maintaining diversity, especially in plantation forests. In previous studies, researchers have reported the strong relationship among various factors (i.e., soil composition, mean annual temperature, etc.) and shrub diversity. However, how these factors jointly influence shrub diversity and which factors could be considered the key factors is still unknown. In this study, we attempted to quantify the effect among environmental factors, soil factors and forest stand factors on shrub diversity. Twenty-seven variables were selected from 57 Chinese pine plantation plots in Huanglong Mountain, Yanan City, Shaanxi Province, China. The path models showed that latent variable of soil properties is the main effective factor of latent variable of shrub diversity (directly effect, path coefficient = 0.344) and the latent variable of site conditions is another effective factor of latent variable of shrub diversity (indirectly effect, path coefficient = 0.177); Besides, the latent variable of site conditions and forest properties directly affect the latent variable of soil properties (path coefficient = 0.514 and 0.326, respectively). Among the latent variable of soil properties, soil water content (SWC) has the biggest weight of 0.666, which indicated the most significant contribution of SWC to latent variables of shrub diversity. Total nitrogen, weighted 0.375, and total phosphorus, weighted 0.308, are also important factors and make a similar contribution to latent variable of shrub diversity. Soil organic matter (SOM) has a minimal impact (lowest weight, 0.059); among the objective variables of site condition, altitude contributes the most and is followed by litter thickness, weighted at 0.722 and 0.448, respectively. Furthermore, among all the variables affecting the latent variable of forest properties, forest age is recognized as the maximum impactor of soil property change, which weighted −0.941; and is followed by forest stock volume and diameter at breast height (DBH), weighted 0.795 and 0.788, respectively. The crowding index (C) has the lowest weight (−0.235) and demonstrated that spatial distribution and crowding of trees have minimal impact on the latent variable of Soil properties. diversity Overall, our study provides new insights into quantifying the relationships among different driving factors that potentially play a significant role in determining shrub layer diversity within the plantation forest.

In western Canada, the effects of warming and increasing human activity may alter the structure, composition, and function of forests, producing quantitatively and qualitatively different understory light conditions. While difficult to measure directly, process-based models may facilitate inference of historical forest states. Yet, existing models are limited in the dynamics they represent. A promising new approach in hybrid modeling, first demonstrated here, is the fusion of machine learning and process-based models to simulate pattern-based processes. The objective of this dissertation was to simulate the effects of past-century climate and fire conditions on understory global solar irradiation trajectories across a 25.2 million ha landscape in Alberta, Canada. The LANDIS-II forest landscape model was applied to simulate past-century changes to competition, fire, and regeneration. Simulated tree species and age maps were classified into landcover types. A regression model of canopy light transmission as a function of landcover and site index showed good fit with field observations (R2 = 0.94) and was applied to a classification of LANDIS-II outputs. Canopy light transmission was multiplied by mean annual bare-earth global solar irradiation to produce understory light maps. Empirical and semi- mechanistic fire models were also applied. A variant of stochastic gradient descent was applied for parameter optimization, improving fire model performance (R2 = 0.96; ΔR2= +0.14). Simulations showed a mild decline in forested area across the 1923-2012 period, attributable to a velocity of warming three times faster than migration. Migration was primarily controlled by fire and secondarily by regeneration. Simulated understory light levels declined across the period due to reduced mortality rates, preceding a likely long-term increase in light attributable to reduced regeneration rates. The key innovations of this work are as follows: characterization of human-dominated fire regimes in western Alberta (Chapter 4); advancement of the TACA-GEM regeneration model (Chapter 5); development of an algorithm for fire model parameter optimization (Chapter 6); development of new LiDAR models of canopy light transmission (Chapter 7); demonstration of a new hybrid modeling approach to simulating pattern-based processes, applied to understory light (Chapter 8); demonstration of long-term climatic regulation of understory solar irradiation through forest regeneration (Chapter 8).

Plant trait patterns contribute to understanding the process of community assembly. Using a trait-based method, recent studies have found that, both the spatial component and abiotic environment filtering drives community structuring. However, the community abiotic environment may be influenced by overstory community and species composition, and it is not enough to disentangle the environment filters only considering abiotic factors. In this paper, leaf size and SLA of 11 understory species were measured, and variation portioning was used to explore the explanation power of spatial process, three topographic variables and seven biotic factors describing the overstory community. The results indicated spatial structure, topography and overstory characters contribute to the leaf variation, and biotic environment have significant effects on leaf trait variations. We concluded that community structure and species composition play important roles in community trait patterns, and biotic filtering should be considered in future trait-based studies.

Empirical analyses of forest dynamics are important for understanding various ecological processes underlying particular forest communities, among which tree mortality is considered a key process driven by many local factors. To evaluate the effects of tree size, as well as biotic and abiotic factors on tree mortality, we compared species-specific mortality rates in a 21-ha temperate multi-species natural forest in northeastern China, where all trees had been mapped. Our study shows that the mortality rates are highly variable among the different tree species and the influence of habitat preference on the mortality rate of a species across habitats was insignificant. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we further found that among the drivers of tree survival, tree size had the strongest effect across different species. There are significant negative relationships between the basal area of conspecific neighbors and tree survival at the community level across almost all the guilds. Regarding abiotic factors, elevation had a greater effect on tree survival than other topographic variables did. Abiotic factors affected shrubs more than tall canopy species in terms of survival rate. Our study suggests that tree size, density-dependent effects and niche partitioning contribute to the regulation of survival pattern of temperate forest communities, but the relative importance of these factors varies greatly among guilds and species. This study has shown that it is essential to consider the relative importance of both, intrinsic (tree size) and extrinsic (biotic and abiotic) factors in analyzing tree mortality.

Understory plants are important components of forests because they are responsible for the majority of the vascular plant diversity of forest ecosystems. The richness and composition of understory communities are closely related to the tree layer diversity, structure and composition. The aim of this study was to examine the understory diversity of Anatolian black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold subsp. pallasiana (Lamb.) Holmboe)-dominated forests on the Kazdağı Mountains of West Turkey. To describe the overstory structure and composition in a numerically and quantitatively well-defined manner, cumulative abundance profiles (CAPs) of the tree species were used. The resemblance of the sampling plots was classified into five stand types assessing the CAP through the Fuzzy C-Means clustering method. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was performed to test the variance of the community ecological distance between the five stand types, and the results showed significant differences in these clusters. Many shade-tolerant plants were associated with the mixed stands of Anatolian black pine–Kazdağı fir. The composition of the herb and shrub layer could not be explained by the environmental variables but by differences in the overstory structure of the stands. Pure or nearly pure Anatolian Black pine stands were more diverse than mixed oak–Anatolian black pine and Kazdağı fir–Anatolian black pine stands. However, although dense and young pure Anatolian black pine stands had the most diverse plant species in the shrub layer, they were ranked third in terms of the herb layer diversity. The Anatolian black pine–Kazdağı fir mixed stands had the lowest herb and shrub layer diversity. These results allow us to comprehend the relationship between the overstory structure and composition, and the understory diversity. Understanding this relationship is important for the conservation of understory plant diversity in the management of forest ecosystems.

Significant treeline advance can only occur with successful establishment, growth, and survival of new seedlings. Several studies have examined microsite factors at single locations to explain the presence/absence of seedlings at treeline. We conducted a much larger observational study and included multiple factors to determine (1) which variable(s) was/were most important, (2) whether their importance differed between aspects, and (3) whether the same variables explained variation in seedling growth and damage. We analyzed five biophysical and six shrub variables along four forest–tundra ecotones in southwest Yukon at 640 points. The model that best explained seedling occurrence was similar between north‐ and south‐facing slopes. Of all variables, seedling occurrence was best explained by the proximity, height, and upslope orientation of shrubs (relative to the seedling). The data indicate an optimal range of shrub cover, which differed with aspect. On north‐facing slopes, seedlings occurred most often when shrub cover exceeded 13%, while on south‐facing slopes seedlings occurred most when shrub cover was between 9% and 72%. We also found that with the exception of shrub‐related factors, very few biophysical variables explained size and growth characteristics and damage of tree seedlings, suggesting that the relative strength and importance of variables change depending on the life stage and size of the tree seedling. Collectively, our results demonstrate a non‐random distribution of seedlings in the forest–tundra ecotone, suggesting that as shrub distributions change with climate change, colonization sites for seedlings will also be influenced.

Species occurrence is subjected to the particular ecological constraints of each site where species that can become dominant exert strong influence on community structure and functioning. Given the harsh environmental conditions in alpine areas and the low number of woody species able to support them, we wanted to study the effect of the main abiotic (environmental conditions related to topographical situation and bedrock type) and biotic (functional type of the dominant species) factors on functional structure and processes of alpine subshrub communities. In 24 study sites, we collected aboveground biomass and raw litter. Biomass was sorted into functional groups (shrubs, graminoids, forbs, bryophytes, lichens), which, in turn, were separated into photosynthetic and structural compartments. We characterized community structure in terms of biomass allocation of functional groups, estimated leaf primary production and litter persistence, and performed analyses of variance for each of the factors considered. Our results showed that community structure is driven mainly by the functional type of the dominant species, although abiotic factors are also relevant. Production depends on abiotic conditions. It is constrained by low temperatures in northern exposures and by low water availability in permeable bedrock types. Litter decomposition depends on environmental conditions and the dominant species characteristics. It is limited by dry conditions in southern slopes and by the thick and N-poor leaves of evergreen subshrubs. In summary, the few alpine woody species able to build specific communities in the Pyrenees grow in particular topographical situations, where they become crucial drivers of ecosystem structure and functioning. © 2017 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic

Moreover, understory could provide habitat and resource specificity to sustain rare or exclusive species in the herbaceous layer, which have excellent potential for use as biodiversity indicators (Spyreas and Matthews 2006). Thus, several forest understory species are well-known indicators of site conditions, impact of forest management and effects of climate change (Gracia et al. 2007; Chavez and Macdonald 2012), and could act as a useful indicator of forest sustainability, ecosystem health and conservation status (Dale et al. 2002;Lencinas et al. 2008a;Chavez and Macdonald 2012). ...

Background Understory plants represents the largest component of biodiversity in most forest ecosystems and plays a key role in forest functioning. Despite their importance, the influence of overstory-layer composition on understory plant diversity is relatively poorly understood within deciduous-evergreen broadleaved mixed forests. The aim of this work was to evaluate how tree overstory-layer composition influences on understory-layer diversity in three forest types (monospecific deciduous Nothofagus pumilio (Np), monospecific evergreen Nothofagus betuloides (Nb), and mixed N. pumilio-N. betuloides (M) forests), comparing also between two geographical locations (coast and mountain) to estimate differences at landscape level. ResultsWe recorded 46 plant species: 4 ferns, 12 monocots, and 30 dicots. Canopy-layer composition influences the herb-layer structure and diversity in two different ways: while mixed forests have greater similarity to evergreen forests in the understory structural features, deciduous and mixed were similar in terms of the specific composition of plant assemblage. Deciduous pure stands were the most diverse, meanwhile evergreen stands were least diverse. Lack of exclusive species of mixed forest could represent a transition where evergreen and deciduous communities meet and integrate. Moreover, landscape has a major influence on the structure, diversity and richness of understory vegetation of pure and mixed forests likely associated to the magnitude and frequency of natural disturbances, where mountain forest not only had highest herb-layer diversity but also more exclusive species. Conclusions Our study suggests that mixed Nothofagus forest supports coexistence of both pure deciduous and pure evergreen understory plant species and different assemblages in coastal and mountain sites. Maintaining the mixture of canopy patch types within mixed stands will be important for conserving the natural patterns of understory plant composition in southern beech mixed forests.

To better understand the relationship between the distribution of understory plants and environmental factors in Pinus tabuliformis plantation, the occurrence and distribution of understory plants were investigated on 42 plots in Songjiagou of Taiyue Mountain, Shanxi Province, China. The environmental factors controlling understory plant composition and diversity were quantitatively assessed by the method of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The results showed that: 1) 83 understory species belonging to 26 families and 72 genera were recorded on 42 plots. The number of species in the herb layer was more than 3 times of that in the shrub layer. 2) The results of CCA clearly reflected the relationship between the distribution of understory plants and environmental gradients. Forward variable selection showed that stand age, slope, slope aspect, canopy cover, total nitrogen and total potassium were important factors determining plant distribution in the herb layer, while stand age, slope aspect, slope, and total nitrogen were important in the shrub layer. 3) Habitat and biotic factors together explained 40. 3% and 42. 9% of variance in the distribution of herbaceous and shrub plants, respectively. Pure habitat factors exhibited a strong interpretation power for understory species distribution, suggesting that habitat factors might play an important role in the distribution variation of understory plants. The results of the study would provide a reference for scientific management, biological protection and sustainable utilization of P. tabuliformis plantation.

La mayor diversidad florística de los bosques templados se encuentra en el componente herbáceo y arbustivo del sotobosque, en estos, la flora adquiere gran importancia ecológica y funcional. Los procesos esenciales del ciclo de nutrientes y la trayectoria sucesional, dependen directamente de la vegetación del sotobosque. Por ello, es necesario realizar la caracterización florística de estas comunidades y conocer su diversidad. En este estudio se determinó la composición y estructura de las especies herbáceas y arbustivas en bosques densos de Pinus hartwegii (Lindl) y Abies religiosa (Kunth Schltdl. et Cham.) del Nevado de Toluca y se cuantificó la abundancia de regeneración arbórea en 10 cuadrantes continuos de 10 m × 10 m. En las especies menores a 50 cm de altura se estimó la cobertura y abundancia con base en la escala Braun-Blanquet. En las especies mayores a 50 cm se obtuvo el valor relativo en cobertura, frecuencia y densidad, además del valor de importancia. De acuerdo con los resultados obtenidos, la flora del sotobosque de Abies religiosa posee una mayor riqueza y está compuesta por 33 especies, 25 géneros y 14 familias, donde Asteraceae es la familia dominante. El sotobosque de Pinus hartwegii registró un total de 18 especies, 16 géneros y 10 familias, con dominancia en cobertura y abundancia de la familia Poaceae. En ambas comunidades vegetales la abundancia de la regeneración es mayor en plántulas y menor en brinzales y latizales.

In the southern Pyrenees, human population and therefore land uses have changed from forests to pastures, then crops, and back to pastures and secondary forests during the last two centuries. To understand what such rapid land use changes have meant for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, we used data from two forest sites in the western Pyrenees, combined with regional data on pastures and crop production (potato, cereal), to calibrate the ecosystem-level model FORECAST. Then, we simulated 150-year of land use for each site, emulating historical changes. Our estimates show that the conversion from forests into pastures and crops created C and N deficits (378-427 Mg C ha-1, 4.0-4.6 Mg N ha-1) from which these sites are still recovering. The main ecological process behind the creation of these deficits was the loss of the ecological legacy of soil organic matter (SOM) created by the forest, particularly during conversion to farming. Pastures were able to reverse, stop or at least slow down the loss of such legacy. In conclusion, our work shows the deep impact of historical land use in ecosystem attributes, both in magnitude of removed C and N stocks and in duration of such impact. Also, the usefulness of ecological modelling in absence of historical data to estimate such changes is showcased, providing a framework for potential C and N stocks to be reached by climate change mitigation measures such as forest restoration.

Background: The dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus – with high cover, height, and fruit production – benefits capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus).Aims: Our aim was to quantify landscape (e.g. elevation, geographic location, and precipitation), site (e.g. overstorey cover and stoniness) and very fine scale factors (e.g. spatial associations in the understorey) that affect cover, height, and fruit production of V. myrtillus in subalpine forests in thePyrenees, with understorey usually dominated by Rhododendron ferrugineum.Methods: We sampled 155 plots (0.5 m × 5 m) in six sites. For each plot, in the understorey layer, we assessed species cover, height for R. ferrugineum and V. myrtillus, number of total fruits in V. myrtillus, and spatial associations among V. myrtillus and the remaining cover types.Results: Overstorey cover negatively influenced V. myrtillus cover, its height, and particularly, the number of fruits, which was also negatively influenced by R. ferrugineum cover. Associations between R. ferrugineum and V. myrtillus were site dependent, while V. myrtillus showed mostly positive associations with grasses and mosses.Conclusions: Reducing overstorey and R. ferrugineum cover has the strongest positive effect on increasing V. myrtillus fruit production, but with additional positive effects on V. myrtillus cover and height. Increases in grass and moss coverage could favour V. myrtillus.

Understory vegetation is crucial and necessary for the stability and biodiversity in plantation forests. However, the role of understory vegetation is easy to be neglected in traditionally intensity plantations. To date, the foliar functional traits of understory shrub in different plantation types are still in debate. Herein, a field–based restoration experiment with different plantation types was conducted to explore the variation of foliar functional traits of understory shrubs in two 13-year reforested plantations and assess which is the most suitable understory species for the plantation development and succession in subtropical China. The results showed that the foliar functional traits of the understory shrubs were species-specific. Both L. cubeba and I. asprella had higher specific leaf area (SLA) and photosynthetic pigments, suggesting that they can efficiently acquire and utilize light in the understory shade environment rather than M. candidum and R. tomentosa regardless of the plantation types. Also, the leaf N and P concentrations of L. cubeba and I. asprella were significantly larger than those of the other two species. Moreover, the SLA, leaf N and P concentrations were significantly positively related to the leaf photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoid) within the two plantations. These further supported that the L. cubeba and I. asprella can adapt well to the shade environment. Therefore, considering the higher SLA, leaf N and P concentrations, and photosynthetic pigments in L. cubeba and I. asprella, we strongly recommend that L. cubeba and I. asprella can be selective species for the understory management in the subtropical plantations of southern China.

Slope aspect effect on soil and vegetation in a Mediterranean ecosystem
Article

    Jan 1993

    P. Kutiel

Differences in soil properties were found between north- and south-facing slopes located in a Mediterranean region with an average annual rainfall of 690 mm. In general, the differences are small, and in some cases even insignificant. The amount of organic matter, Na, Cl, and K, and available nitrogen (N-NH4and N-NO3) are higher in the northern aspect than in the southern one. However, pH, CaCO3, and available P are significantly higher in the southern than the northern aspect. The differences between the aspects in plant species diversity are very great and are expressed mainly in relatively dry winters. The higher species diversity in the south-facing slope is due to the presence of herbaceous, mainly annual, plants. The importance of such differences in the Mediterranean region is discussed.

From 1988-97, the diet of the capercaillie was studied in a Central-European mixed spruce-beech-fir and mountain spruce forest in the Velka Fatra Mts., Mala Fatra Mts., Starohorske vrchy Mts., and Nizke Tatry Mts., West Carpathians). In the spring (March-May), capercaillies fed mainly in crowns of trees (94% proportion in March, 78% in April, and 55% in May). Beech (Fagus sylvatica) buds and Norway spruce (Picea excelsa) needles were the main food of the birds during this season. In the summer (June-September), capercaillies preferred feeding on the ground (82% proportion in June, 99% in July, 96% in August, and 74% in September). Summer diet consisted of 32 bis 48 plant species. Animal food was taken accidentally (below 3%). In the autumn (October-November), capercaillies fed mainly in crowns of trees (58% proportion in October, 70% in November). Winter diet (December-February) of the capercaillie consisted almost exclusively of the Norway spruce (Picea abies) needles (91% in December and 86% in January). The rest of the winter diet was made up of other woody plants (Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, and Acer pseudoplatanus).

Soil moisture regimes are influenced by a complex array of biotic, edaphic, and topographic factors. Understory species provide the potential to depict landscape-scale moisture patterns because they integrate across these influences in both time and space. We examined the relationship between soil moisture and understory species in old-growth Douglas-fir, true fir, and Douglas-fir/true fir transition forests in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, located in the Western Cascades of Oregon. Using multivariate statistical analyses, we determined that a quick survey of understory vegetation could provide reasonable estimates of relative spatial differences in soil moisture. Classification analysis separated the understory species into two communities that were differentiated primarily along an elevation (temperature) gradient, and the high elevation community had wetter soil on average. Within these communities, individual species could be used as indicators of relative moisture differences. Our data support the existing habitat typing model for this region that elevation (temperature) and moisture are the main determinants of vegetation zones and associations. They also suggest that understory species are sensitive enough to be used as soil moisture indicators even in a predominantly mesic watershed.

Population dynamics of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus in relation to bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus production in southern Norway

Forester T. Grasaas' data on numbers of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cocks and hens observed at leks and clutch sizes in Vegarshei, southern Norway, during 1953-1962 (high population level) and 1969-1978 (low population level) were analysed with regard to bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus production, autumn population indices and snow conditions in spring. From the mast depression hypothesis, it was predicted that the number of capercaillies counted at leks and the mean clutch size should be high after high seed crops (masts) of bilberry, usually produced at intervals of 3-5 years. In stepwise regression models, both the bilberry index of the preceding year and the autumn population index one (hens) or two (cocks) years earlier contributed to explain the mean number of capercaillies counted at leks during 1970-1978. Capercaillie clutch sizes were highest in years with early thaw, but the effect was significant only for the period 1969-1978. For this period, there also was a positive effect of the bilberry index and a negative effect of the autumn population index of the previous year. It is concluded that the synchronous population fluctuation of grouse and voles in Norway and Sweden cannot be explained by the alternative prey hypothesis alone, and that food quality should also be considered as a possible contributing factor when analysing population fluctuations of grouse and other herbivorous species.

On a local scale, damage was greatest under trees and on hummocks, where the snow cover was thin. On a regional scale, Vaccinium myrtillus had suffered most in the coastal areas (89% bud damage), where the thickness of the snow cover was <20cm during the intense cold in January. In the E and N parts of the country, where snow depth was ↔30cm, damage was slightest (16%). Lingonberry V. vitis-idaea suffered less than bilberry. The crop of the following summer reflected these differences, being negligible in the coastal areas and abundant in the E and N parts of Finland. -from Authors

We investigated the effects of winter controlled burning on the breeding habitat of the Pyrenean gray partridge (Perdix perdix hispaniensis Reich.). Floristic composition and vegetation structure were sampled on 198 sites, including 64 recently used by hens for nesting or rearing of broods, 90 within partridge habitat burned under dry conditions, and 44 burned under wet conditions. During the early breeding season, birds selected shrublands of broom (Cytisus purgans (L,) Boiss,) with an average canopy coverage of 60% and an average height of 0.50 m. Birds avoided sites where shrub cover was more than 80% or less than 20%. The most critical effect of burning on gray partridge brood habitat was the reduction of the cover in the 2 vegetation layers providing protection against predators (0.05-0.25 m, and 0.25-050 m). In the case of "dry burning", the recovery of suitable habitat took more than 8 years for nesting hens and flightless chicks, but only 5-6 years for broods older than 3 weeks. Data obtained by radio-tracking eight broods indicated that "wet burns" (mean size = 4 ha) were better than "dry burns" (mean size 15 ha) for maintaining good brood habitat. For the "dry burns", we recommend that burned patches be equal to or less than 5 ha and separated by unburned patches of 10-15 ha. In both eases, the frequency of fires should not exceed once every 15-20 years.

1 Seedlings of 10 European tall-shrub species and the shade-tolerant tree Fagus sylvatica were grown at 0.3, 1.6, 11, and 63% daylight for 110 days on chalk grassland soil, and on a more nutrient-rich soil developed under Crataegus monogyna. 2 Crataegus monogyna, Fagus, Juniperus communis, Cornus sanguinea, Ligustrum vulgare and Rosa canina suffered high mortality in 0.3% daylight, but only the first three had losses in 1.6%. Overall mortality in deep shade (0.3, 1.6%) was considerably lower in Euonymus europaeus, Rhamnus catharticus, Viburnum lantana and V. opulus. Average mortality in deep shade on grassland soil was negatively correlated with embryo-cum-endosperm dry mass (EEM). Overall mortality in deep shade was significantly greater with higher nutrient supply. 3 In 63% daylight relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively correlated with log EEM, and positively with specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) at time of planting but not at final harvest, i.e. differences in RGR were determined more by unit leaf rate (rate of dry mass gain/leaf area) in the latter part of the experiment. 4 The responses of the species to irradiance and nutrient supply were appreciably different. Cornus, Ligustrum, Prunus spinosa, Rhamnus, and Rosa increased yield strongly under high irradiance on nutrient-poor soil, and responded also markedly to nutrients. Viburnum lantana and Euonymus grew relatively slowly in all treatments, but the former was responsive to nutrients, even in deep shade. Viburnum opulus was more responsive to irradiance but responded to nutrients only in 11% daylight. Crataegus grew more slowly on its `own' soil than on grassland soil. Juniperus differed consistently from the other species, growing slowly, and responding strongly to irradiance. Fagus responded moderately to irradiance and not to nutrient supply. 5 In shade allocation to roots decreased, while allocation to stem and to leaves increased generally. All species produced a smaller number and total area of leaves, and increased SLA and leaf area ratio (leaf area/total dry mass). Shoot and root lengths were reduced in shade. 6 The results are discussed in relation to the roles of the various species during secondary succession, and their regeneration niches.

A large, minimally disturbed, and floristically diverse old-growth forest (Hawk Woods) on the Allegheny Plateau in south-eastern Ohio was studied to compare woody vegetation structure, composition, and soils both within and among communities. Five vegetation types were initially identified based on visual estimates of dominance and indicator species: mixed mesophytic, mixed oak-tulip poplar, white oak, oak-hickory, and oak-heath. Principal components ordination did not reveal distinct groupings of stands within and among vegetation types. Further quantitative analysis suggested that fewer ecological groupings were sufficient to describe vegetation types. Cluster analysis supported three ecological groupings apparently related to a topographic-moisture continuum. Multivariate analysis of variance of soil variables indicated significant differences among stands. Linear correlation of soil variables with principal components suggested the presence of a soil nutrient gradient associated with the topographic-moisture gradient. Edaphic parameters were not useful for discriminating community types but did however covary with the vegetation continuum. Size-class analysis of vegetation types indicated similarities and differences both among communities within Hawk Woods and among other forests in the Plateau region. Diameter distribution curves for vegetation types were observed to fit the negative power function more closely than the negative exponential function. Size-class distributions of individual species varied, apparently as a function of broad-scale ecological characteristics (e.g., shade tolerance). Quercus spp. exhibited marked underrepresentation in the smaller size-classes, suggesting an inability to self-perpetuate.

1. Ground-vegetation succession was analysed at four Swedish coniferous sites 8-16 years after clear-felling. At each site, three levels of logging-residue harvesting were applied in a randomized block design: (i) above-stump whole-tree harvesting (no residues remaining); (ii) harvesting all tree parts except needles; and (iii) conventional harvest (residues left on site). 2. Vegetational changes at each site were analysed by principal component analyses. Successional changes were related to the first principal components, whereas residue treatments were related to components of the second or lower order. 3. Treatment-related differences in species cover, as analysed by a two-way ANOVA, were noted at all sites, 8 as well as 16 years after harvest. The covers of most vascular plant species, notably herbs and graminoids, were generally lower after whole-tree harvesting, while the covers of epigeic lichens and Vaccinium myrtillus were higher. Bryophytes were mostly indifferent to logging residue treatment, except for Pleurozium schreberi which had a lower cover in plots without logging residues. The overall differences were small and resembled those found along natural soil fertility gradients. 4. The presence of woody debris appeared to have a weak, suppressive effect on the cover of the graminoids Deschampsia flexuosa and Luzula pilosa. This effect was only evident on the first study occasion, about 8 years after felling. 5. Our results suggest that the major influence of logging residues left on site was related to their nutrient contribution. The impact tended to decrease over time and, in a long-term perspective it is suggested that treatment differences in species cover will be small, especially in forests developing dense canopies. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that repeated whole-tree harvesting will produce more drastic effects by reducing soil nutrient availability.

This study quantified relationships of understory vascular plant species composition and richness along environmental gradients over a broad spatial scale in second-growth oak forests in eastern North America. Species frequencies were recorded in 108 25 × 25 m plots in four study sites extending over 70 km in southern Ohio, U.S.A.. The plots were stratified into three long-term soil moisture classes with a GIS-derived integrated moisture index (IMI). In addition to the IMI, the environmental data matrix included eight soil and three overstory variables. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that variations in understory species composition were most strongly related to topographic variations in predicted moisture (IMI), N mineralization rate, nitrification rate, and soil pH. In addition, floristic variation at the regional scale was correlated with variations in soil texture, nitrification, pH, and PO_4^−, resulting from differences in the soil parent material complexes among sites. Species richness averaged 65 species/plot, and increased with moisture and fertility. Stepwise regression indicated that richness was positively correlated with N mineralization rate and nitrification rate, and inversely correlated with tree basal area. Greater richness on fertile plots was the largely the result of increasing forb richness. Forb richness per quadrat (2 m^2) was most strongly and positively related to N mineralization rate. Conversely, richness of understory individuals of tree species was greatest on xeric, less-fertile plots. Our results describe general, broad-scale species-environment relationships that occurred at both the topographic scale (long-term moisture status and fertility) and the regional scale (geomorphological differences among the sites). Strong species richness-N mineralization correlations indicate an important link between below-ground processes and above-ground biodiversity. Because N availability was a strong correlate to vegetation patterns at a broad-scale, our results suggest that the increasing rates of atmospheric N deposition in the region could have a major impact on understory vegetation dynamics.

Understanding the relationships between forest overstory and understory communities is essential for predicting changes in the abundance and distribution of understory plants through successional time and in response to forest management. We used correlation analysis, multiple regression, and nonparametric models to explore the relationships between overstory characteristics (canopy cover, stand density, and tree-size distributions) and the abundance of species in the herb and shrub layers in mature forests of western Washington. Overstory variables explained >50% of the variation in the mean response of total shrub cover and ca. 50% of the variation in cover of Acer circinatum Pursh (the most common shrub species) and late-seral herbs (species reaching their greatest abundance in late-successional forests). Stronger relationships (80-90% variance explained) were found between overstory variables and the maximum cover of total shrubs, A. circinatum, total herbs, and each of three functional groups of herbaceous species. These empirical relationships represent both direct resource limitations and time-dependent responses for which overstory characteristics may be surrogates. Models of maximum abundance yielded the most consistent results, suggesting the relative importance of different overstory variables as limiting factors for understory response, although these limiting factors have different effects on plants with different life-history strategies.

This study reports results from a first analysis of vegetation dynamics in permanent plots in Swedish boreal forests. The plots are a part of the international cooperative programme on integrated monitoring of air pollution effects on ecosystems (ICP IM), which is part of the long-range transboundary air pollution convention (LRTAP) of the united nation’s economic commission for Europe. In Sweden, there are four ICP IM monitoring sites, established 1982–1999. Vegetation measurements are made about every second year to be able to detect and follow possible changes in species composition.Ellenberg indices for light, moisture, pH and nitrogen were used as indirect metrics of environmental conditions. Vegetational gradients were explored by multivariate ordination methods. All gradients were short, less than 1.5 units in detrended correspondence analyses. Despite the short gradients, all sites showed spatial variation that could be related to different Ellenberg indices. A temporal trend in species composition was detected only at one site. At this site time accounted for 8% of the variation in the data set and a spatial variable accounted for 13%. Correlations between ordination plot scores and Ellenberg indices indicated that the temporal trend was partly caused by increasing light regime and decreasing soil moisture.

The aim was to analyse the short-term effects (0–4 years) of selection fellings and clear-cutting on bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), one of the dominant field layer plants in the Swedish boreal coniferous forests. Bilberry is a major source of food for many herbivores. The effects of forest harvesting were studied on bilberry characteristics of potential importance for herbivores. Five characters of bilberry growth (vegetative investment, shoot survival, ground cover, shoot weight and production of current annual shoots), two of reproduction (reproductive investment and success) and four of chemical composition (water, nitrogen, carbon and phenol content) were measured. Sunlight reaching the field layer was also measured.

We investigated the immediate response of mature (mean stand age 102 years) boreal spruce forest understorey vegetation to four different felling methods on 1-ha study plots in southern Finland. We hypothesized that understorey vegetation response depends on the intensity of the felling method. Vegetation was sampled before the treatments and the year following them, when resident understorey vegetation had not had time to recover from the disturbance and pioneer species were still scarce or absent.Response of understorey vegetation differed significantly between the treatments. Bryophyte species number decreased significantly in single-tree selection system felling (33% of stand volume felled), retention felling (93% felled) and standard clear felling, but remained at the pre-treatment level in gap felling (50% felled) and in control plots. Bryophyte cover decreased significantly over all treatments, except the residuals of the gap felling and the controls. Number of vascular plant species decreased significantly only in clear felling and retention felling, while cover of vascular plants decreased significantly in all treatments, including controls. Vegetation response to gap felling and single-tree selection system felling was rather similar at the stand level. However, there were significant differences between the felled areas and residuals in gap felling in post-treatment vegetation species composition and cover. Retention felling and clear felling did not differ significantly from each other in terms of vegetation response. Apparently the residual tree groups, which contained 7% of the pre-treatment stand volume, were too small to have significant sheltering effect on late successional vegetation in or outside of residuals.

Local forest ecosystem types were identified using an iterative approach consisting of reconnaissance, plot sampling, and multivariate data analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that aspect and other environmental variables were highly correlated with the ground flora and canopy tree species. A multifactor classification comprising 10 ecological land type phases (ELTPs) was based on cluster analysis of the six most important physiographic and edaphic factors. The characteristic vegetation of each ELTP was specified by distinctive groups of mature canopy trees and of ground flora species identified by two-way indicator species analysis. Within this unglaciated area of southeastern Ohio, the majority of the landscape comprises moderately to steeply sloping terrain. Quercus dominated dry and dry-mesic ridgetops and slopes, while Liriodendron tulipifera L. and Acer saccharum Marsh. dominated mesic slopes and wet-mesic ravine bottoms. In general, many of the 17 ecological species groups of ground flora plants were more closely related to the major environmental gradients than were six groups of canopy tree species. Multiple-response permutation procedures were used to corroborate the differences in these two vegetation layers among ELTPs. This classification system was developed to provide an ecological framework as the basis for ecosystem management on the Wayne National Forest.

Interrelationships between dominant compositional and environmental gradients were studied using 186 forest stands sampled on the east slope of the Sangre de Cristo Range, Colorado. Detrended correspondence analysis and detrended canonical correspondence analysis were used to analyze indirect and direct gradients, respectively. The dominant compositional gradient was strongly correlated with elevation. Increasing elevation was associated with decreasing soil pH and percent base saturation, and increasing total soil N. Ordination of stands stratified by elevation showed the major compositional gradient within each elevation class was strongly correlated with a topographic moisture index. Most soil variables correlated with this gradient in low and high elevation classes. In mid-elevation forests, a third compositional gradient correlated with soil pH, percent base saturation, and potential solar radiation. In these forests, Pinus contorta and Pseudotsuga menziesii were associated with acidic soils on north-facing slopes, whereas Populus tremuloides and Abies concolor were associated with base-rich soils on south-facing slopes. Ordination axes accounted for least variation in comparatively young mid-elevation forests. A plausible explanation is that the mid-elevation forests represent an unpredictable stage in forest development where competition has not yet had sufficient time to sort species along environmental gradients.

Forest overstory composition influences both light and nutrient availability in the mixed boreal forest. The influence of stand composition on understory cover and biomass was investigated on two soil types (clay and till deposits). Four forest composition types were considered in this study: aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and a mixture of balsam-fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). The cover of all understory species was recorded while the biomass of two important and ubiquitous species was measured: mountain maple (Acer spicatum Lam.) of the shrub layer and large-leaved aster (Aster macrophyllus L.) of the herb layer. Soil analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of overstory composition on understory biomass through its influences on soil characteristics. Analyses of variance showed a significant effect of forest canopy type on mountain maple biomass, understory cover and shrub cover but not on herb cover and large-leaved aster biomass. Path analysis was performed to explore the relationships between canopy type, nutrient availability and understory biomass. Contrary to what was expected, the variation in plant biomass associated with forest composition was weakly related to soil nutrient availability and more strongly related to stand structural attributes.

In Finland, yields of forest berries are a way of measuring the forest’s value as a recreation environment. Berry picking is also an activity of direct economic value. When planning forest management, the effect of silvicultural treatment on berry yields should also be assessed. With the assistance of current forest planning methods, the best method for this assessment is to apply numerical models. This study utilised expert modelling in order to determine the dependence of cowberry and bilberry yields on the characteristics of the site and the tree stand. The modelling technique applied uses the results of paired comparisons of stands, with respect to berry yields, as the dependent variable, and measurable site and stand characteristics as independent variables. Compared to the Analytic Hierarchy Process, the method does not require a complete set of paired comparisons of stands, which means that many stands can be evaluated without unreasonable efforts. The predictions correlated logically with site and stand characteristics and were in line with earlier models.

Summary 1 Although it is well established that nitrogen and light play major roles in structuring plant communities across the landscape, it is not as clear how they structure com- munities within forest stands. Virtually nothing is known about within-stand structure of understorey communities of herbs and small shrubs in near-boreal forests. 2 We tested the hypothesis that fine-scale (5-20 m) variability in N and light structure forest-floor plant communities in two old-growth mixed Pinus resinosa and Pinus strobus forests in north-eastern Minnesota, USA. 3 In each forest, all trees > 1.4 m tall were mapped on a 0.75-1.0 ha area. A grid of sub- plots 5-10 m apart was established (total n = 147), and N mineralization ( µ g g − 1 soil day − 1 ), soil depth (cm), light (% canopy openness), and percentage cover of all herbs and small shrubs were measured on each subplot. 4 Cluster analysis showed that the dominant understorey species fall into three groups. Group 1 is unrelated to N and light, and is negatively associated with a midstorey of the small tree Acer rubrum and the most abundant tall shrub Corylus cornuta . Group 2 reaches maximum abundance in places (mostly gaps) with relatively high light, but is unrelated to within-stand variation in N availability. Group 3 consists of a single species, Aster macrophyllus , and reaches maximum abundance in areas with low N availability and low abundance of Corylus , but higher than average abundance of P. strobus and Betula papyrifera overstorey trees. 5 N and light have a moderate influence on understorey plant community structure. The plant species do arrange themselves along N and light gradients, but the gradients are likely to be too narrow to allow the degree of differentiation seen at the landscape level. Spatial patterning of the species groups is probably influenced by other factors, including disturbance history, chance and neighbourhood effects such as clonal reproduction.

1 The influence of fertilizer addition and mammalian herbivore exclosures (a 2 × 2 factorial design, with four replicates at each of two sites) on the cover, species composition and diversity of the understorey vegetation of the boreal forest in the south-western Yukon, Canada, were investigated from 1990 to 1999. This was done to test whether vegetation composition was controlled by resource level alone (bottom-up control), herbivory alone (top-down control), or by both (interactive control). 2 The density of the major herbivore, the snowshoe hare, varied 25-fold, declining from 148 km−2 in 1990 to 8 km−2 in 1994, and increasing to a second peak of 198 km−2 in 1998. 3 In control plots most species were remarkably constant in percent cover. After 10 years, most of the major species showed significant responses to fertilizer with four species increasing (Festuca altaica, Mertensia paniculata, Epilobium angustifolium, and Achillea millefolium), and three declining (Linnaea borealis, Lupinus arcticus, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). Some species took up to 5 years before a response was detected. 4 Fertilization caused (i) a decline in the number of species, and species evenness in the community, (ii) a reduction in the proportion of woody species, and (iii) an increase in herbaceous dicotyledons and grasses. 5 The exclusion of herbivores had virtually no impact on the abundance of the vegetation or on species diversity, except in 1990–92 during a decline from a peak of 148 hares km−2 to 29 hares km−2. 6 These results suggest that the percentage cover and composition of herbaceous vegetation in the boreal forest are determined almost exclusively by the productivity of the site (bottom-up control) and that the activities of mammalian herbivores may be important only during peaks in hare population densities (interactive control). 7 Results were both species-specific and time-dependent, suggesting that long-term studies are needed to discriminate between long-term responses to treatments and transient phenomena.

Summary • We investigated the spatio-temporal variation in the interactions between the juniper Juniperus communis and its vertebrate frugivores (avian dispersers of Turdus spp. and predatory rodents Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Mediterranean mountains of south-east Spain. • Frugivore activity was evaluated at six sites and for 3 years, in relation to both plant reproductive traits (plant size, cone crop and cone size) and characteristics of the immediate environment (distance to the nearest female, abundance of perches, fruiting environment and habitat). • Plant characteristics and levels of frugivory varied strongly among the six populations. Cone production, cone size and frugivory also differed significantly among years for the same population. Avian frugivory was only occasionally affected by density of cones per plant, abundance of perches or abundance of other fruiting species, or by habitat. Rodent predation was positively related only to the density of cones per plant and then only in two sites. • Levels of both avian frugivory and rodent predation significantly increased in populations with higher cone production. • Both groups of vertebrate frugivores responded to the spatio-temporal variation in cone abundance at a regional scale, discriminating more between juniper populations than between individual plants within a population. The outcome of interactions with frugivores at the individual plant level thus proved more dependent on the whole-population characteristics than on individual attributes.

    CLIMATIC CHANGE

Based on conclusions drawn from general climatic impact assessmentin mountain regions, the review synthesizes results relevant to the European Alps published mainly from 1994 onward in the fields of population genetics, ecophysiology, phenology, phytogeography, modeling, paleoecology and vegetation dynamics. Other important factors of global change interacting synergistically with climatic factors are also mentioned, such as atmospheric CO2 concentration, eutrophication, ozone or changes in land-use. Topics addressed are general species distribution and populations (persistence, acclimation, genetic variability, dispersal, fragmentation, plant/animal interaction, species richness, conservation), potential response of vegetation (ecotonal shift – area, physiography – changes in the composition, structural changes), phenology, growth and productivity, and landscape. In conclusion, the European Alps appear to have a natural inertia and thus to tolerate an increase of 1–2 K of mean air temperature as far as plant species and ecosystems are concerned in general. However, the impact of land-use is very likely to negate this buffer in many areas. For a change of the order of 3 K or more, profound changes may be expected.

Recovery of the bilberry (Vaccinium Myrtillus L.) from artificial spring and summer frost

Vegetative and sexual recovery of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) was monitored in the field for three growing seasons after artificially applied spring and early summer frost. Bilberry recovered vegetatively (density and biomass) by vigorous production of new ramets and by production of large shoots in the damaged ramets. Recovery did not occur sexually (production of flowers), however. Summer frost was slightly more detrimental than the spring frost, but the difference was significant only in the percentage of flowering ramets. The results showed that bilberry is buffered against moderate frost injury. The rapid vegetative recovery guarantees survival of the plants after frost damage, whereas sexual reproduction may need accumulation of resources for many seasons. Consequently, the ability of bilberry to recover from sporadic frosts increases its potentiality to persist in a changing environment, where increasing temperature leads to earlier snowmelt in the spring, and increases the risk of frost injuries in plants that overwinter under snow.

The species composition and diversity of the ground flora (vascular plants less than one meter in height excluding tree seedlings) were compared between sixteen mesic northeast-facing and sixteen dry southwest-facing middle slopes in southeastern Ohio. On each aspect, eight of the plots were located in second-growth forest stands (70 to 90years in age) and eight of the plots were located in old-growth forest stands (greater than 150years in age) in order to determine how the ground flora on opposing slopes varies with time since major disturbance. Physiographic and A horizon characteristics were measured to select comparable plots. Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) detected significant differences in the ground-flora species composition of second-growth and old-growth plots on both northeast-facing and southwest-facing slopes. In addition, the ground-flora species composition of northeast-facing plots differed significantly from that of southwest-facing plots. Northeast-facing plots were significantly higher in species richness and Hill's diversity (N1) than southwest-facing plots. Northeast-facing second-growth plots were also significantly higher in species richness and Hill's diversity than northeast-facing old-growth plots. No significant differences in these measures were found between southwest-facing second-growth and old-growth forests plots. Twenty-one species were identified as potential indicators of age, based on their distribution across the plots. Certain species with similar ecological characteristics were found to have similar patterns of occurrence. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which differences in the ground flora of second-growth old-growth reflect the sensitivity of individual species to past disturbance.

Geographical ecology and variation of plant-seed disperser interactions - Southern Spanish junipers and frugivorous thrushes

    Pedro Jordano Pedro Jordano

Spatial and temporal predictability in the mutual selective pressures of plants and frugivorous birds is a prerequisite for coevolution to occur. I examine the interaction patterns of strongly frugivorous thrushes (Turdus spp.) and their major winter food plants (Juniperus spp., Cupressaceae) and how they vary in space and time. Spatial congruency, rarely considered in seed dispersal studies, is studied at three spatial scales: 1) the total species range; 2) regional distribution; and 3) local abundance and its variation between seasons. Southern Spanish frugivorous thrushes and junipers show very low congruence in distribution patterns at each of these scales. Most juniper species show geographic distributions that are nested within the geographic ranges of thrush species. Bird species showed greater habitat breadth values than plants and were found in a greater percentage of localities. The local bird abundance was strongly correlated across years and sites with the local availability of juniper cones. Cone production varied markedly between years, but the rankings for different species in different years were statistically concordant at mid-elevation and lowland sites. Both bird abundance and cone production showed greater temporal than spatial variability. Variation of cone productions at both temporal and spatial scales was greater than variability in bird abundance. Species with strong interactions of mutual dependence showed very low values of biogeographic congruence, caused by differences in geographic range and habitat specificity. This obviously limits the possibilities for pairwise, specific coevolution to occur. However, mutual effects of species groups are possible to the extent that the component species are ecologically interchangeable in their selective effects and other constraints on coevolution are not operating. The approach used here to examine the patterns of species interactions at different biogeographic scales might prove useful in comparative studies of plant-animal interactions.

Sexual and vegetative reproduction in the alpine species Rhododendron ferrugineum was studied along a successional sequence (meadow open heathland closed heathland) at two sites and in a wet heathland. This study aims to determine (1) the characteristics of sexual reproduction in R. ferrugineum populations (2) when and how these populations develop layering (adventitious rooting) and (3) whether reproductive traits and reproductive strategies develop relative to the degree of population closure and maturity. The variables used to describe sexual reproduction were inflorescence density (per m(2) of Rhododendron cover), number of flowers per inflorescence and per m(2) of Rhododendron cover, and seeds production (per fruit and m(2) of Rhododendron cover). Flowering and fruiting phenologies were also recorded. For describing clonal development, we investigated layering variables such as length and annual growth rate of prostrate stems, rooting occurence and ramet density. The results show that the direction toward which the clones extend is mainly determinated by the topography, and that layering steadily increases with increasing population closure and maturity. Reproductive potential of R. ferrugineum is enormous (0.4–2.4 million seeds m(-2)) but reproductive effort remains low with respect to total biomass of seeds (3–21 g m(-2)). Reproductive effort of R. ferrugineum populations could be reduced as a conterpart of layering development only when the shrub draws more matter and energy in layering stems than to aerial stems. The variations in reproductive traits observed on our sites could be due to primarily to phenotypic response to variable microhabitat features, rather than to genetically deterministic processes.

The relationship between environmental parameters (bedrock type, temperature and moisture index) and understorey species richness was studied from a large phytosociological data base on Pyrenean Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests. Generalized linear models were used to test this relationship. Total species richness and species richness of the different life forms were considered. The results suggest different patterns for the different life forms, and that the richest forest was on the calcareous bedrock of north-facing slopes at low altitudes.

We examined spatial and temporal variability of understory herbaceousvegetation on opposing north- and south-facing slopes in an eastern deciduousold-growth forest in southeastern Ohio, USA. Secondly, we explored theinfluenceof sampling scale and analytical technique on our assessment of diversitypatterns. The influence of aspect and seasonality were examined at varyingsampling scales using observed richness, evenness, andH diversity measures, non-parametric richnessestimators, species-area curves, and SHE analysis. Herb layer composition,abundance, and diversity were strongly influenced by location (north slope vs.south slope), seasonal sampling period (April, June, August), and plot size(micro (2 m2)- vs. meso (70m2)-scale samples). Although north and south plots werecompositionally distinct, they followed similar courses of change through thegrowing season. Richness, evenness, and H diversitywere generally greater on the south plot whereas herbaceous abundance wasgreater on the north plot. Species composition and diversity showed markedphenological (temporal) changes, and comparison of diversity measures at micro-and meso-scales produced markedly different results. Minimum sample areas of150–200 m2 were needed to evaluate micro-scalerichness in these species rich communities, suggesting that forest understoriesmay be frequently undersampled in ecological studies. Comparison of observedandestimated meso-scale richness also suggested underestimation of richness in thenorth plot, particularly earlier in the growing season. Thus, sample size,area,and time of sampling appear critical to assessment of diversity in spatiallyandtemporally variable communities such as herbaceous forest understories.

This study investigates the effects of slope aspect on plant community characteristics such as plant cover, species composition and above-ground biomass production in Mediterranean trees and shrubs in two climatological regions. Two experimental sites were selected in a climatic gradient that runs from the foothills of the Judean Hills to the northern Negev desert in Israel. In each site, 16 quadrats of 10 m 10 m (eight south-facing and eight north-facing slopes) were established and the vegetation was recorded. Dominant tree and shrub species were measured using allometric parameters of area and volume, and representative branches were cut and weighed. Species studied were Quercus calliprinos, Phillyrea latifolia, Pistacia lentiscus, Cistus creticus, Coridothymus capitatus, and Sarcopoterium spinosum. The results showed that slope aspect had significant effects on the composition, structure and density of the plant communities developing in both sites. Vegetation structure within a site changed significantly in the short distance separating the north and south-facing slopes, and that pattern remained generally constant when comparing the two sites along the rainfall gradient. The data collected here provides new insight into the slope aspect effects on biomass allocation of different woody life forms of eastern Mediterranean plant communities.

Habitat selection by capercaillie in summer and autumn: Is bilberry important?

The use of habitat by female and male adult capercaillie Tetrao urogallus during summer and autumn was studied by comparing the distribution of radio locations of birds with the availability of habitat at forest stand, home range and landscape level in an area of the Bavarian Alps, Germany. Capercaillie preferred forests with structural features typical of their main distribution range, the boreal forest: they selected large patches of old forest with moderate canopy cover of about 50%, and a well developed field layer with high proportions of bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus. Hens selected both home ranges and sites within home ranges in old forest. Ranges selected by cocks did not differ from availability in the study area, but they preferred old forest within their ranges. The size of home ranges was negatively related to bilberry cover both in hens and cocks. The distribution of bilberry also determined habitat use by capercaillie at the landscape scale. The study demonstrated that bilberry is the major determinant of the selection of habitat by capercaillie in landscapes with sparse and fragmentary cover of ericaceous shrubs, such as central Europe.

Sierra Nevada forests have high understory species richness yet we do not know which site factors influence herb and shrub distribution or abundance. We examined the understory of an old-growth mixed-conifer Sierran forest and its distribution in relation to microsite conditions. The forest has high species richness (98 species sampled), most of which are herbs with sparse cover and relatively equal abundance. Shrub cover is highly concentrated in discrete patches. Using overstory tree cover and microsite environmental conditions, four habitats were identified; tree cluster, partial canopy, gap, and rock/shallow soil. Herb and shrub species were strongly linked with habitats. Soil moisture, litter depth and diffuse light were the most significant environmental gradients influencing understory plant distribution. Herb cover was most strongly influenced by soil moisture. Shrub cover is associated with more diffuse light, less direct light, and sites with lower soil moisture. Herb richness is most affected by conditions which influence soil moisture. Richness is positively correlated with litter depth, and negatively correlated with direct light and shrub cover. Disturbance or management practices which change forest floor conditions, shallow soil moisture and direct light are likely to have the strongest effect on Sierran understory abundance and richness. ¬© Springer 2005.

Modeling the distributions of shrub species in Pacific northwest forests

In Pacific Northwest forests, understory species are important elements of forest structure and composition, providing habitat and forage for wildlife and contributing to much of the floral diversity. Knowledge of the factors that control the distribution and abundance of understory species is central to understanding the ecology and dynamics of natural forests and how they will respond to management. Generalized linear models of the binomial family were used, at two spatial scales, to estimate the probability of occurrence of shrub species as a function of environmental variables and the cover of mature and regenerating tree species. Graphical analysis and resampling techniques were used to: (1) examine whether species show unimodal responses to environmental gradients; (2) explore the scale-dependence of model forms; and (3) predict areas of high probability of species occurrence within a multi-dimensional environmental space. Results suggest that the concept of unimodal response to environmental gradients can be used to improve predictions about species' distributions, and to strengthen the biological interpretation of statistical models. They also demonstrate the scale-dependence of model equations and the likelihood that key processes influencing plant distributions may change, or appear different, when viewed at different scales.

The relationship between logging intensity and changes in ground cover vegetation was studied in 16 species and groups of species recorded at 10- or 11-year intervals in mature conifer-dominated forests. The 789 plots located in northern and central Sweden had been surveyed by the National Forest Inventory and the National Survey of Forest Soil and Vegetation. Thirty-seven percent of the plots had been subjected to a thinning or clear-cutting between the inventories. A principal components analysis showed that, of the variables considered, logging intensity had the highest explanatory power regarding change in ground cover vegetation between the inventories (the other variables were sum of temperatures, age of stand, timber volume, percentage Pinus sylvestris and site productivity). A multivariate direct gradient analysis technique (Redundancy analysis) showed that the logging intensity significantly affected the change in cover. This analysis also ranked the species in their responsiveness to logging. Epilobium angustifolium, narrow-leaved grasses and broad-leaved grasses, increased most with logging intensity. The response was not linear and only detectable at high logging intensities (>80%). In contrast, Vaccinium myrtillus seemed to decrease linearly with increased logging intensity. There was several years time-lag in the response to logging of E. angustifolium, V. myrtillus and narrow-leaved grasses. Several species and groups of species seemed unaffected by the logging. In sample plots unaffected by logging the cover of most species decreased.

We investigated relationships between edaphic and environmental factors (soil, forest floor, topography, and canopy) and understory vegetation (composition, richness, and Shannon–Wiener diversity index, H′) among 77 plots representing seven major patch types comprising a landscape in northern Wisconsin that has a long history of human management. Sampled patch types included: (1) mature hardwoods; (2) young hardwoods; (3) mature red pine; (4) mature Jack pine; (5) young mixed pine; (6) clearcuts; and (7) open pine barrens. Within each plot, percent cover of understory plant species was estimated, along with canopy cover (%), litter cover (%), coarse woody debris (%), duff depth (Oe and Oa horizons, cm), slope, aspect, and overstory data. Soil samples were taken and analyzed in the laboratory for pH, moisture, organic matter, nitrogen, and carbon. Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and stepwise multiple linear regression were used to examine differences in variables among patch types and to quantitatively relate the environmental variables to species richness and H′. Differences in species richness were only found between clearcut and hardwood patch types. Of the site variables, canopy cover differed most among patch types. Relationships between diversity and site factors were weak overall, but improved somewhat when patches were separated by overstory characteristics (i.e., coniferous, deciduous, open canopy), with soil factors differing in their relative effects on vegetation according to overstory properties. This suggests that a higher-level control pertaining to the overstory type overrode the effects of local variables on understory plant diversity. Important site variables influencing vegetation were canopy cover, pH, and forest floor characteristics. DCA ordination separated patch types according to canopy cover, soil moisture, and duff depth gradients. Species composition showed greater differences among patch types than did quantitative measures of diversity; these differences occurred primarily between patch types that were less qualitatively similar in terms of overstory. Thus, managers should focus on composition rather than numeric diversity measures to maintain landscape-level plant diversity.

The effects of canopy disturbance on the abundance, growth, morphological plasticity, biomass allocation and fruit production of velvet leaf blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloides Michx.) were examined in 1996 in a second-growth boreal mixedwood forest near Nipigon, northwestern Ontario that had been logged by either shelterwood cutting or clearcutting in 1993. We found that V. myrtilloides was able to persist in both open and closed canopy boreal mixedwood forests managed for commercial timber extraction. Persistence under heavy shade conditions was accompanied by significant morphological and biomass allocation plasticity. Specific leaf area, leaf area, individual leaf weight, and the proportion of total biomass in stems and foliage changed along an understory light gradient from 0% to 67% percent photosynthetic photon flux density (% PPFD). The degree of above-ground morphological plasticity may explain blueberry's ability to survive under low light conditions. Reproductive performance of V. myrtilloides was greatest under the partial shade conditions associated with shelterwood cutting. Blueberry bushes growing in clearcuts overgrown with 3-year old aspen (Populous tremuloides Michx.) saplings remained mostly vegetative whereas the number, fresh weight and dry weight of berries in shelterwood cuts was 94% grater than that produced after clearcutting. We attributed the lower fruit yields in the clearcuts to heavy shading from regenerating hardwoods, and mechanical damage to above-ground biomass. The paucity of seedling regeneration as well as extensive mechanical damage to above-ground stems by logging equipment delayed vegetative regeneration of V. myrtilloides in large canopy openings of the clearcut blocks. Unlike other more aggressive ericaceous species (e.g. Kalmia angustifolia var. angustifolia L., Gaultheria shallon Pursh.), V. myrtilloides was unable to resist invasion from faster growing hardwood species (e.g. P. tremuloides) and was rapidly overtopped. V. myrtilloides plants in the uncut control blocks received 3.9% of full sunlight, whereas those growing in the partial cut and clearcut blocks received an average of 25.3% and 32.5% PPFD, respectively. Cover of vegetation over-topping blueberry plants was highest in the uncut forest (90.3%), but was not significantly different between the partial cut (45.5%) and clearcut (50.1%) treatment blocks.

The abundance and height of three common shrubs (bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, cowberry V. vitis-idaea and heather Calluna vulgaris) in Scots pine Pinus sylvestris woodland in Scotland were studied in relation to irradiance and browsing by herbivores (deer). In particular, we were interested in how these variables could be manipulated in order to increase the abundance of bilberry, a species that contributes substantially to pinewood biodiversity. Bilberry cover was greatest at intermediate irradiance, which coincided with high crown forest stands, and was least in the thicket stages of forest development. It was also less abundant where there was a high level of browsing. By contrast, heather cover and height increased with irradiance. In order to increase bilberry in Scots pine woodland, and thereby enhance woodland for wildlife, managers should aim to match stand densities to particular tree heights to provide the best light conditions for bilberry, allowing it to compete successfully against heather. This may mean reducing tree densities in plantations, but increasing them in the more open stands of native pinewoods. Because browsing by deer appears to reduce bilberry abundance, it may also be important to reduce numbers of deer to increase bilberry.

Clearcutting is a common harvesting practice in many eastern hardwood forests. Among the vegetation strata of these forests, the herbaceous layer is potentially the most sensitive in its response to harvest-mediated disturbances and has the highest species diversity. Thus, it is important to understand the response of herbaceous layer diversity to forest harvesting. Previous work on clearcut and mature stands at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF), West Virginia, has shown that, although, harvesting did not alter appreciably herbaceous layer cover, it influenced the relationship of cover to biotic and abiotic factors, such as tree density and soil nutrients, respectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the response of species diversity of the herbaceous layer to harvesting at FEF. Fifteen circular, 0.04 ha sample plots were established in each of four watersheds (60 plots in total) representing two stand age categories: two watersheds with 20 years even-age stands following clearcutting and two watersheds with mature second growth stands. All woody stems ≥2.5 cm diameter at breast height were identified, tallied, and measured for diameter. The herbaceous layer was sampled by identifying all vascular plants ≤1 m in height and estimating cover for each species in each of 10 (1 m2) circular sub-plots per sample plot (600 sub-plots total). Species diversity for each plot was calculated from herbaceous layer data using the ln-based Shannon Index (H′) equation. Ten stand and soil variables also were measured on each plot. Mean herbaceous layer cover for clearcut versus mature stands was 27.2±14.3% versus 20.2±8.1% (P>0.05), respectively and mean H′ was 1.67±0.42 versus 1.55±0.48 (P>0.05), respectively. Herbaceous layer diversity was negatively correlated with cation exchange capacity and extractable Ca and Mg in the mineral soil in clearcut stands. In contrast, herbaceous layer diversity was positively correlated with soil organic matter and clay content. Although, 20 years of recovery after clearcutting did not have significant effects on the species diversity of the herbaceous layer when examining stand age means alone, harvesting did appear to influence the spatial relationships between herbaceous layer diversity and biotic factors (e.g. tree density) and abiotic factors (e.g. soil nutrients).

Ontogenetic niche shifts and their implications for recruitment in three clonal Vaccinium shrubs: Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Vaccinium oxycoccos

Ontogenetic niche shifts, i.e., changes in niche breadth and (or) position during the life of individuals, have received rather limited attention in plant ecology. An experiment was designed to assess ontogenetic niche shifts in three clonal Vaccinium shrubs in order to examine their recruitment behavior. Seeds were sown, and juveniles transplanted, at sites along a gradient of changing occurrence of the three species. Recruitment was seed limited, varied among sites, and was correlated with juvenile survivorship. No niche shift occurred during seed to seedling stages for any of the plants. For Vaccinium myrtillus L., recruitment was not related to adult occurrence, whereas for Vaccinium oxycoccos L., recruitment was highest at the site where adults dominated. However, for both of these species, recruitment also occurred outside the range of adult occurrence. Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. exhibited a negative relationship between adult occurrence and recruitment and between adult occurrence and juvenile survivorship, indicating an ontogenetic niche shift. For V. myrtillus the results suggested an uncoupling of niche requirements of juvenile and adult stages, whereas for V. oxycoccos the results suggested a niche contraction towards the requirements for adults. Thus, the form of ontogenetic niche shifts differs among the species. These differences in niche shifts contribute to understanding dispersal and recruitment behavior of the species.

A simple model describing herb layer dynamics under the tree canopy was developed to quantify the forage supply of the herb layer to ungulates in forests. The basic principle of this forage supply model is that the herb layer biomass can be described by a logistic curve. The rate of development and the maximally attainable biomass are assumed to depend on the relative light level that reaches the forest floor. Biomass growth is derived from functions describing monthly relative growth rate under open field light conditions in combination with light response curves.

The ancestral habitat of capercaillie in most of its range is Scots pine forest with an understorey of blaeberry. Keillour forest in Perthshire is dominated by Sitka spruce, has little blaeberry, yet had a high density of capercaillie. Food and habitat use by capercaillie were studied there from 1991 to 1994. Seven cocks and two hens were caught, and marked with small radio transmitters. The habitats they occupied and food remains in their droppings provided information on home range, habitat utilization and diet through the year. Sitka spruce was the main food in autumn, winter and spring but was equalled by the fruiting heads of sedge in summer. Larch was the second most abundant item in spring and autumn diets. Sedge was plentiful on the wet restocks associated with the gleyed soils at Keillour and may provide a partial substitute for blaeberry in summer. Capercaillie showed a clear preference for the oldest blocks of trees, especially in winter. Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and Scots pine were used roughly in proportion to their availability in the birds' home range, but larch stands were used more than expected from availability. In summer, all birds used restocks to some extent. Management recommendations to encourage capercaillie in commercial plantations largely comprising exotics are that mature stands over 45 years and well-vegetated restocks should each occupy at least 20 per cent of the forest, larch and blocks of mixed conifers each at least 15 per cent of the ground. Blaeberry should be encouraged and, if possible, patches of windthrow involving living trees with the main root intact should be retained.

Variation in canopy composition can influence ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling and light transmittance, even when environmental soil conditions are similar. To determine whether forest cover type influences species composition of the understory vegetation (herbs and shrubs), the composition of this layer was studied on two different surface deposits, clay and till, and under four different forest cover types dominated, respectively, by Populus tremuloïdes Michx. (aspen), Betula papyrifera Marsh. (white birch), Pinus banksiana Lamb. (jack pine), and Picea glauca (Moench) Voss  Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. (sprucefir) over similar environmental conditions. Detrended correspondence analysis and analysis of variance performed on the ordination scores revealed that understory plant composition was highly affected by surface deposit and forest cover. The gradient observed in the correspondence analysis proceeds from aspen, white birch, sprucefir, to jack pine. Indicator species were identified for each surface deposit and cover type, and most of them were associated with either jack pine or aspen. The richness, evenness, and diversity of the understory vegetation did not vary between cover types, but were affected by surface deposit. By controlling ecosystem processes such as light transmittance and nutrient cycling, forest cover influences understory composition.Key words: cover, understory, composition, boreal forest, environmental condition.

Impact of snow cover on photoinhibition and winter desiccation in evergreen Rhododendron ferrugineum leaves during subalpine winter

Effects of winter snow cover on photoinhibition and possible interactions with winter desiccation were investigated in situ in an evergreen subalpine woody species, Rhododendron ferrugineum L., at the alpine timberline (1950 m a.s.l.). Timing and duration of complete snow cover markedly influenced potential efficiency of photosystem II (PSII; F(v) /F(m)). Lack of snow cover led to severe but mostly reversible photoinhibition with F(v)/F(m) values as low as 0.05. Complete snow cover immediately stopped further reductions in PSII efficiency. Snow cover promoted recovery from photoinhibition, but only if, in addition to shading by snow, plants were exposed to nonfreezing temperatures close to 0 degrees C. The F(v)/F(m) ratio was closely related to minimum leaf temperatures because both photoinhibition and recovery from photoinhibition were strongly influenced by temperature. The period without major reductions in PSII efficiency lasted for only two months, reflecting the extremely short growing period in the subalpine environment. Compared with complete snow cover, incomplete snow cover led to significantly higher water losses as well as lower dehydration tolerance, because both osmotic adjustment and changes in turgor maintenance capacity were significantly reduced. Interactions between photoinhibition and winter desiccation were masked by the direct effects of freezing temperatures. However, both photoinhibition and winter desiccation are closely linked and occur together under field conditions in this evergreen subalpine woody species.

Broad-leaved forest community dominated by Choerospondias axillaries is one of the main forest community types in the hilly area of central Hunan province, which plays a very important role in forest succession processes in subtropical region. In this study, a large permanent plot with an area of 1 hectares was established in the typical forest community of C. axillaries at the Dashanchong forest ... [Show full abstract] farm, Changsha county in the hilly region. The large plot was divided into 100 smaller sample plots of 100 square meters (10m×10m). The characteristics of the C. axillaries community were investigated in detail to analyze biodiversity and regeneration dynamics of the community. In order to investigate the plant diversity of shrub and herb in the smaller plots, 16 small samples were set up and distributed evenly in the sample plots, each small sample with area of 2m×2m. Plant diversity and succession dynamics were analyzed based on these field data. The results showed: (1) in the arborous layer, there were 59 species in total which were more than 1 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH), belonging to 25 families and 42 genera in the community; (2) the dominant species is C. axillaries with the largest important value (IV) of 23.57 in the community. It was characterized with normal distribution in tree heights and DBH for the tree species of C. axillaries, with only 6 saplings of 1.0cm to 1.5 cm in DB.H. (3) The IV was 10.46 for Symplocos setchuensis, 7.98 for Eurya muricata, 5.39 for Vernicia montana, and 4.17 for Litsea coreana, respectively. The ratio of saplings, with less than 1.5 cm in DBH, varied with different tree species, which was 22.0% of saplings for the S. setchuensis population, 16.8% for E. muricata, 11.7% for A. montana, and 11.0% L. coreana, respectively. The diameter structures of the 4 tree species showed an inverted J curve type. (4) Considering the stratified structure of forest stands, the overstory were mainly occupied by C. axillaries, the understorey by S. setchuensis, E. muricata, V. montana and L. coreana. (5) Forest seedlings were mainly dominated by evergreen broad-leaved tree species which regenerated well, with exception of C. axillaries saplings. These results indicated that the advantage of C. axillaries in the community was diminishing, whileas the importance of S. setchuensis, E. muricata, V. montana and L. coreana was increasing. Those evergreen broad-leaved tree species should be the dominate species in next succession stages, suggesting the C. axillaries broad-leaved community in hilly region of central Hunan province was developing toward the evergreen broad-leaved forest community succession. (6) There were a total of 37 species in shrub and herb layer. The species with the largest five important values are Oropetalum chinensis, Rhododendron mariesii, Vaccinium bracteatum, Gardenia jasminoides and Rhododendron simsii, with an IV of 54.59, 21.85, 4.98, 4.63 and 4.53, respectively. The Loropetalum chinensis and Rhododendron mariesii were both dominant species in the shrub layer.

Elevation gradients are frequently used as space-for-time substitutions to infer species’ trait responses to climate change. However, studies rarely investigate whether trait responses to elevation are widespread or population-specific within a species, and the relative genetic and plastic contributions to such trait responses may not be well understood. Here, we examine plant trait variation in ... [Show full abstract] the dominant woody shrub, Rhododendron maximum, along elevation gradients in three populations in the South Central Appalachian Mountains, USA, in both field and common garden environments. We ask the following: (i) do plant traits vary along elevation? (ii) do trait responses to elevation differ across populations, and if so, why? and (iii) does genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity drive trait variation within and among populations? We found that internode length, shoot length, leaf dry mass, and leaf area varied along elevation, but that these responses were generally unique to one population, suggesting that trait responses to environmental gradients are population-specific. A common garden experiment identified no genetic basis to variation along elevation or among populations in any trait, suggesting that plasticity drives local and regional trait variation and may play a key role in the persistence of plant species such as R. maximum with contemporary climate change. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of examining multiple locations in future elevation studies and indicate that, for a given plant species, the magnitude of trait responses to global climate change may vary by location.

Tree tissue chemistry has proven successful in guiding advanced exploration in the early stages of mineral exploration projects in Arctic and subarctic regions. In this paper, the biogeochemical response of three circumboreal shrubs, crowberry (Empetrum nigrum L.), Labrador tea (Ledum palustre) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), and one conifer, common juniper (Juniperus communis L.), to the ... [Show full abstract] underlying hydrothermal Juomasuo Au-Co deposit was assessed in southeast Finnish Lapland. A variety of contrasting spatial multi-elemental anomaly patterns were found for the elements Au and Co, along with Fe, Th, U and rare earth elements, such as Ce, La and Nd, in different plant tissue types over the subcropping lodes and also deep (blind) mineralizations down to a depth of 200 m in two seasonally varying campaigns: in late summer (August) 2013 and early summer (June) 2014. Besides these elements verified by lithogeochemistry, Ag, Bi, Mo, Se, Te, W and Ni exhibited anomalous spatial patterns over the mineralization. Based on the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, the Au concentrations in twigs/stems of crowberry, bilberry, Labrador tea and common juniper over the mineralization were found to be higher than the background, but the evergreen species gave the most consistent response to the mineralization. This also applied to U, W and Mo, as well as Nd and several other rare earth elements. Using unsupervised clustering with self-organizing maps and k-means, the location of the underlying mineralized zones could be determined with high overall accuracy (70–90%). This indicates that the biogeochemical anomaly patterns over the Juomasuo sulphidic lodes are strong, and the deposit would have been detected from the biogeochemical data even without prior knowledge gained from a diamond drilling campaign. The sampled vascular species are widely distributed over the pan-Arctic and circumboreal terrains, thus demonstrating their considerable significance to mineral exploration for hydrothermal Au ores at northern latitudes.

One of the most compelling challenges for conservation biologists is the preservation of species with restricted ranges. Carabus olympiae Sella, 1855, a ground beetle species inhabiting two small areas in the western Italian Alps, is an example of a steno-endemic and endangered insect species. Despite the fact that this species is historically well known to professional and amateur entomologists, ... [Show full abstract] its autecology is virtually unknown. In the present study we used pitfall traps to study habitat selection and phenology, and radiotelemetry to measure differences in movement parameters between sexes, habitats and periods. Data from pitfall trapping suggested that C. olympiae actively selects both shrubberies (alpen rose Rhododendron ferrugineum and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus) and beech forests and avoids pastures, and that population size peaks in July. All radio-tagged individuals (n = 21) moved without a preferred direction, and were more active at night than by day. Males covered greater distances and had more tortuous trajectories than females. Distances covered in forests and alpen rose shrubberies were not significantly different, but paths in beech forests were more convoluted than in shrubberies. The movement pattern observed fits the requirements of a typical "olfactory-tactile" insect predator that looks for prey by systematically exploring its territory. Movement parameters suggested that both beech forests and alpen rose shrubberies are suitable for this species and indicated that the spatial distribution of shrubs in shrubberies can constrain trajectories. The implications for conservation are: (i) any human intervention which results in enlargement of the present coverage of pastures should be controlled; (ii) forest management may be tolerated, with the condition that alpen rose shrubberies remain or develop after tree-cutting; (iii) once a shrubbery has established, it should be preserved through appropriate management.
