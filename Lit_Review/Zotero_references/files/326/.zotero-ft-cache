Abstract and Figures
The timing of phenological events varies both among species, and also among individuals of the same species. Here we use a 12-year record of spring and autumn phenology for 33 woody species at the Harvard Forest to investigate these differences. Specifically, we focus on patterns of leaf budburst, expansion, coloration and fall, in the context of differences between canopy and understory species, and between canopy and understory individuals of the same species. Many understory species appear to adopt a strategy of “phenological escape” in spring but not autumn, taking advantage of the high-light period in spring before canopy development. For all but a few of these species, the spring escape period is very brief. Relationships between canopy and understory conspecifics (i.e. individuals of the same species) varied among species, with leaf budburst and leaf fall occurring earlier in understory individuals of some species, but later in other species. We fit standard models of varying complexity to the budburst time series for each species to investigate whether biological responses to environmental cues differed among species. While there was no clear consensus model, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that a simple two-parameter “Spring warming” model was best supported by the data for more than a third of all species, and well supported for two-thirds of all species. More highly-parameterized models involving various chilling requirements (e.g., Alternating, Parallel or Sequential chilling) were less well supported by the data. Species-specific model parameterization suggested that responses to both chilling and forcing temperatures vary among species. While there were no obvious differences in this regard between canopy and understory species, or between early- and late-budburst species, these results imply that species can be expected to differ in their responses to future climate change.

Phenological Differences Between Understory
and Overstory: A Case Study Using
the Long-T erm Harvard For est Records
Andrew D. Richardson and John O’Keefe
Abstract The timing of phenological events varies both among species, and also
among individuals of the same species. Here we use a 12-year record of spring
and autumn phenology for 33 woody species at the Harvard Forest to in vestigate
these differences. Specifically , we focus on patterns of leaf budburst, expansion,
coloration and fall, in the context of differences between canopy and understory
species, and between canopy and understory individuals of the same species. Many
understory species appear to adopt a strategy of “phenological escape” in spring
but not autumn, taking advantage of the high-light period in spring before canopy
development. For all but a fe w of these species, the spring escape period is very
brief. Relationships between canopy and understory conspecifics (i.e. individuals
of the same species) varied among species, with leaf budburst and leaf f all occurring
earlier in understory individuals of some species, but later in other species. W e fit
standard models of varying complexity to the budb urst time series for each species
to investigate whether biological responses to en vironmental cues differed among
species. While there was no clear consensus model, Akaike’ s Information Criterion
(AIC) indicated that a simple two-parameter “Spring warming” model was best

well supported by the data. Species-specific model parameterization suggested that
responses to both chilling and forcing temperatures vary among species. While
there were no obvious differences in this regard between canopy and understory

1 Introduction
Plants exhibit both phenotypic plasticity and genotypic adaptation to different
growth environments (Schlichting 1986 ; Sultan 1995) . In terms of phenology , these
responses can be manifest as differences in spring budburst and autumn senescence
within species across environmental gradients at varying scales, from re gional (e.g.,
across the native range of a species; see Lechowicz 1984 ; Raulier and Bernier 2000)
to local (e.g., along an elevational gradient: see Richardson et al. 2006) and even
microsite (e.g., with regard small-scale topographic variation and cold air drainage,
see Fisher et al. 2006) . These patterns are commonly interpreted in the context of
differences in temperature regime among different gro wth environments.
However , just as differences in light environment between understory and canopy
result in well-known differences in leaf structure (Boardman 1977 ; Lichtenthaler
et al. 1981) , so too can plants respond to the ambient light environment by adopting
different phenological strategies. For example, man y herbaceous understory species
in temperate deciduous forests have been shown to adopt “phenological escape”
(Crawley 1997) strategies of shade avoidance in order to increase the seasonal
integral of potential photosynthesis and to capitalize on other seasonally-limited
resources for growth (e.g., Muller 1978) . By emerging earlier in the spring than
canopy species (or by delaying autumn senescence), shade-avoiding understory
plants can take advantage of a short-lived high-light gro wth environment (e.g.,
Sparling 1967 ; Mahall and Bormann 1978 ; Crawley 1997) . As demonstrated by
greenhouse studies, early-emerging individuals not only hav e more time to grow,
but also grow more quickly and accumulate more resources than individuals that
emerge later (Rathcke and Lacey 1985) . Textbook examples of herbaceous species
adopting the escape strategy include Hyacinthoides non-scripta and Anemone
nemorosa (Crawley 1997) . Such a strategy is not without tradeoffs, however: early-
emerging individuals often hav e a lower chance of survival, but much higher repro-
ductive success, than individuals that emer ge later (Rathcke and Lacey 1985) .
Earlier emergence increases susceptibility to spring frost damage which may not
only damage photosynthetic machinery but also lead to foliar necrosis (e.g., Gu et al.
2008) . Also, plants that emerge under high-light conditions may not be morphologi-
cally well-adapted to low light conditions. For example, work by Sparling (1967)
demonstrated that herbs emerging in spring, prior to canopy closure, had photosyn-
thetic characteristics of shade intolerant species, whereas species emerging in mid-
summer exhibited shade tolerant characteristics (see also Hull 2002) . However,
Rothstein and Zak (2001) reported that acclimation of individual leaves could occur
as the growing season progressed and the below-canopy light en viron ment changed:
leaves of V iola pubescens emerged prior to canopy closure with sun leaf character-
istics, but as the canopy closed, both chemical (e.g., N partitioning to Rubisco vs.
chlorophyll) and structural (leaf mass to area ratio) acclimation resulted in the same
leaves becoming more like shade leav es, and thus better suited to a low-light
environment.
While phenological escape is well-documented for herbaceous species, much
less is known about the degree to which this strategy is adopted by woody plants,
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 89
either shrub/small tree species restricted to the understory, or juv enile/suppressed
individuals of canopy species. Previous work in this re gard has generally been
focused on a relatively limited number of species, and results have not been entirely
consistent among studies. While the overall pattern is one of understory species and
juveniles of canopy species leafing out earlier in spring, but not necessarily dropping
their leaves later in autumn, than mature canopy trees (Gill et al. 1998 ; Seiwa
1999a, b ; Augspurger and Bartlett 2003 ; Barr et al. 2004 ; Augspurger et al. 2005) ,
important questions remain. For example, how widespread is the phenological
escape strategy among woody understory plants? Or, what traits do species adopting
this strategy have in common? And, are there differences between understory species
and juveniles of canopy species in terms of how this strategy is e xpressed?
In the sections that follow , we begin by providing a brief review of how the
understory growth environment v aries from season to season. We then discuss
evidence for phenological variation within and among species, first broadly and
then specifically with regard to differences between understory and canopy . This is
followed by an ev aluation of potential fitness consequences of different phenologi cal
strategies. W e then use data from the long-term phenology records maintained at
the Harvard Forest as a case study to in vestigate the following questions in the
context of patterns of spring (budburst and leaf expansion) and autumn (leaf colora tion
and leaf fall) phenology for an entire forest community , comprising 33 different
woody species:
1. Are there differences in phenology between understory tree and shrub species
and canopy tree species (i.e., those that have the potential to grow into the
canopy)?
2. Within the class of canopy species, are there differences in phenology between
suppressed individuals growing in the understory , and dominant or co-dominant
individuals in the overstory?
3. Given that year-to-year v ariation in weather (e.g., warm vs. cool spring) gener-
ally results in corresponding shifts in the timing of phenological events (Hunter
and Lechowicz 1992) , how do species differ in their sensiti vities to climatic vari-
ability? For example:
(a) Is the sequence in which species reach particular phenophases consistent
from year to year?
(b) Are there differences among species (particularly with regard to canopy vs.
understory species) in terms of which temperature-based model to predict
budburst is best supported by the data?
1.1 Seasonal V ariation in the Understory Growth Environment
The seasonal patterns of light availability for various canopy strata in a temperate
deciduous forest depend largely on the development and senescence of the ov erstory
canopy (throughout this remainder of this chapter we use “canopy” and “overstory” as
90 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
synonyms), with changing zenith angle and overall solar irradiance acting as sec-
ondary factors (Baldocchi et al. 1984) . As an example, data from the Bartlett
Experimental Forest, a northern hardwood (maple-beech-birch) forest in central
New Hampshire, indicate a rapid spring decrease in the fraction of photosyntheti-
cally active radiation transmitted through the canopy ( f TP AR ) as the developmental
trajectory progresses from a leafless (day 121 in Fig. 1a ) to a fully-foliated (day 165
in Fig. 1a ) canopy. Over a period of roughly 1 month, f TPAR declines from ~ 50% to
~ 5% (Fig. 1b , see also Baldochi et al. 1986 ; Gill et al. 1998) . During this time the
understory light environment is extremely heterogeneous, as canopy species leaf
out at different times and leaf elongation proceeds at different rates (Kato and
Komiyama 2002) . With canopy closure, sunflecks become ever more important for
understory photosynthesis (Chazdon and Pearcy 1991) . In the autumn, the reverse
pattern occurs, over a similarly brief period, with the onset of leaf senescence and,
ultimately, abscission. It is important to note that the physical presence of the canopy
does not necessarily mean the canopy is physiologically active (Sakai et al. 1997) :
particularly in the autumn, canopy photosynthesis is reduced with the onset of
Day 121 Day 138 Day 165

senescence, but shading of the understory continues until canopy leaves are
actu ally dropped.
Beyond fluxes of photosynthetically active radiation, the presence or absence of
a full canopy affects other aspects of energy and mass transfer , with implications
for various factors affecting gro wth and development of understory plants, includ ing:
leaf temperatures and saturation deficit; precipitation throughfall as well as soil
surface heat flux and evaporation; and diurnal ranges of air and soil temperatures.
1.2 Phenological Differences W ithin and Among Species
For a given tree species, climatic gradients (particularly latitude but also elev ation)
are a dominant control on phenology, as b udburst by higher-latitude and higher-
elevation individuals generally follo ws that of lower-latitude and lower-elev ation
individuals (e.g., Lechowicz 1984 ; Richardson et al. 2006 ; Fisher et al. 2007) . This
can be attributed to varying rates of spring warming, as temperature is considered
the primary trigger for spring budburst, at least in temperate, boreal, and arctic
ecosystems. However , provenance trials indicate that there is genetic variation
among populations in terms of responsiveness to en vironmental cues. For example,
in common-garden experiments, northern populations have generally been shown
to leaf out in advance of southern populations, although the reverse is true in some
species (Lechowicz 1984) .
In temperate forests, coexisting tree species commonly leaf out at different times,
from the typically early emergence of Betula and Populus , to the late emergence of
Quercus and Fraxinus . Among these species, budburst dates vary by 3 weeks or
more in a temperate deciduous forest in Quebec, although a similar ordering of
related species is observed both elsewhere in North America and also in Europe
(Lechowicz 1984) . At the same time, the rate of canopy development also dif fers
among species, with leaf elongation proceeding rapidly in some species ( Prunus and
Acer ) but more slowly in other species ( Juglans and Carya ) (Lechowicz 1984) .
Perhaps surprisingly, the timing of b udburst is not correlated with ecological niche
(e.g., shade tolerance) or with phylogenetic history (both advanced and primitive
families can be either early or late leafing out, and within families, and ev en within
genera, there is just as much variation as among families); howe ver, noting that
many late-leafing tree species tended to be ring-porous (i.e., woody species in which
the xylem vessels laid down at the beginning of the gro wing season are much larger
in diameter than those produced later in the growing season), Lechowicz (1984)
hypothesized that ring-porous species leaf out later than diffuse-porous species
because large diameter vessels are more prone to cavitation caused by freeze-thaw
xylem embolism. Thus in ring-porous species budburst can only occur after new xylem
has been formed each spring, as otherwise there would be little or no capacity to
transport water to developing leav es. In diffuse-porous species, on the other hand,
the hydraulic conductivity is less affected by winter freezing, and leaf dev elopment
can occur in advance of, or concurrently with, the formation of new xylem.

1.3 Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory
Woody understory shrubs, small trees, and juv enile seedlings and saplings of canopy
tree species might all be expected to exhibit phenological escape strategies similar
to those of herbaceous understory species, but previous research has provided mix ed
results. Here we review some of this earlier work.
Comparing the phenology of woody understory plants (three understory species,
and juveniles of two canopy tree species) with the development and senescence of
the forest canopy , Augspurger et al. (2005) found that for four of the five species
studied, leaf expansion preceded canopy development. The f irst of these four,
Aesculus glabra , leafed out more than 3 weeks before the canopy and received
approximately 97% of its annual irradiance during this spring high-light period.
Budburst and foliar development of the f ifth species, Asimina tribola , was slow and
lagged behind canopy development. Senescence and leaf drop of Aesculus occurred
roughly 2 months before the canopy , but for the other four species the timing of
autumn senescence was similar to that of the canopy . Gill et al. (1998) reported
earlier leaf expansion and later autumn senescence in Viburnum alnifolium , an
understory shrub, compared to the northern hardwood canopy species. But, in a
deciduous boreal forest, foliar development of the early-flowering b ut compara-
tively late-leafing hazelnut ( Corylus cornuta ) understory lagged that of the P opulus
tremuloides canopy by 3 weeks or more. Here, aspen were found to require only
about half as many degree-days as hazelnut to reach the same level of de velopment
(Barr et al. 2004) . This study also reported greater interannual variability in both
spring and autumn phenology for canopy, compared to understory species. The
woody species Aesculus sylvatica , a small deciduous tree native to the southeastern
United States has an unusual spring-green phenology similar to that of many under-
story herbs. Its leaves emerge in mid-March, only to senesce in late May when the
canopy above is beginning to close (dePamphilis and Neufeld 1989) . For this
understory species, the growing season is very short and is restricted to the high- light
period of spring.
Juvenile and mature individuals of canopy tree species can also differ pheno-
logically. Seiwa (1999a, b) reported that phenology changed with ontogeny in both
Acer mono and Ulmus davidiana . In both species, there was a general pattern of
later leaf emergence with increasing tree age and tree height (from small seedlings
to saplings to small trees and large trees). Similar results were reported by
Augspurger and Bartlett (2003) , who compared the phenology of juvenile and adult
individuals of 13 different deciduous species. Budburst of juv eniles was signifi-
cantly earlier (average » 8 days) than that of conspecific (i.e., of the same species)
adults (see also Gill et al. 1998) in ten species; for none of the species was the
opposite pattern observed.
There is a wide range of variability in phenological differences between juveniles
and adults in autumn. For example, whereas there was no significant age-related
difference in the timing of autumn leaf drop for Acer (Seiwa 1999a) , seedlings of
Ulmus retained their leaves longer than mature trees (Seiwa 1999b) . Similarly mixed
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 93
results were presented by Augspurger and Bartlett (2003) , who reported that for
most of the 13 species studied, the timing of onset of senescence and completion of
leaf fall did not vary between juveniles and adults. Where significant dif ferences
were observed, the pattern of variation was not consistent among species: juveniles
retained their leaves longer in some instances (e.g. Acer saccharum ), but shorter in
others (e.g. Aesculus glabra ). In contrast to these results, Gill et al. (1998) found that
understory Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia retained green leaves later in
autumn than overstory trees of the same species.
On the basis of the springtime patterns, Seiwa (1999a, b) suggested that the
overall net benefits of earlier leaf-out must therefore decrease with increasing tree
height, reflecting a shifting balance between the advantages (increased carbon gain
and reduced susceptibility to herbivory , e.g., Crawley 1997) and the disadvantages
(risk of frost damage, e.g., Lechowicz 1984) of early leaf out. This would seem to
be a logical explanation: for individuals deep under the canopy , leafing out early
offers the largest rew ards. By comparison, for dominant canopy trees, the competi-
tion for light has already been “won”, and leafing out early is of much less benefit.
Thus, one would predict that leaf expansion “progress from the base of the canopy
upward” but autumn senescence “[progress] from the top of the canopy downward”
(Gill et al. 1998) .
1.4 Consequences of Different Phenological Strategies
Studies of phenological differences among individuals, either among species or
within species, have sought to explain patterns of phenological variation by consid-
ering how different phenological strategies could work to enhance an indi vidual’s
fitness. This might be achieved through maximization of carbon gain, minimization
of the likeli hood of frost damage, exploitation of seasonally limited resources such
as light, water or nutrients, or reduction of herbivory by completing foliar develop-
ment (including lignification and production of secondary metabolites) before insect
emergence.
As suggested above, the potential photosynthetic gains to understory plants
from leafing out prior to canopy development are lar ge. Data from the Bartlett
Experimental Forest indicate that the accumulated below-canopy flux of photo-
synthetically active radiation (P AR) increases at a rate of » 15 mol photons m
−2
d
−1
from snowmelt through the onset of canopy dev elopment (i.e., when f tpar » 0.50
in Fig. 1b ), whereas from the completion of canopy development to the onset of
senescence, accumulated transmitted P AR increases at a rate of only » 1.5 mol
photons m
−2
d
−1
( f tpar » 0.05), a tenfold difference. Between snowmelt ( » day
105) and the end of the year, the accumulated transmitted P AR equals » 900 mol
m
−2
; of this total, roughly half is received between snowmelt and the midpoint of
canopy development ( » day 130). These data help to explain how , as reported in
the literature, opportunistic species such as the herbaceous perennial Erythronium
94 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
americanum , which emerges almost immediately after snowmelt but is senescent
soon after canopy closure (Mahall and Bormann 1978) , can essentially complete
their life cycle before the passing of the summer solstice (e.g., Muller 1978).
Similar gains might be expected of understory plants that retain their leaves in
autumn longer than canopy trees. However , in terms of potential photosynthetic
carbon assimilation, a high-light day at the beginning of the growing season pro-
vides greater stimulation of photosynthesis than a high-light day at the end of the
growing season. There are at least three reasons for this. First, the maximum inci-
dent solar radiation flux is higher in the spring than the autumn, and the zenith
angle is larger; both of these translate to considerably more light being transmitted
through to the understory in the spring compared to autumn. Second, spring tem-
peratures are generally warmer and more favorable to photosynthesis than autumn
temperatures, and water tends to be less limiting in spring (especially following
snowmelt) than in autumn (Chen et al. 1999) . Third, seasonal declines in both leaf
area and photosynthetic capacity mean that as senescence approaches, whole-plant
rates of uptake tend to be lower than in spring (Gill et al. 1998) . However, this is
not universal: in some species the photosynthetic capacity of elongating leaves is
quite low , which may prevent efficient exploitation of high irradiances in late
spring. For example, Morecroft et al. (2003) reported that after budburst, Quercus
robur took 2 months to reach peak photosynthetic capacity.
The potential increases in plant carbon gain resulting from phenological escape
have been ev aluated both through observational as well as modeling studies.
Harrington et al. (1989) compared the phenology and photosynthesis of two native
and two exotic shrubs growing in a W isconsin forest and found that the exotic spe-
cies had leaf life spans that were almost 2 months longer than those of the native
species. Further analysis showed that the exotic shrubs accumulated roughly 30% of
their annual carbon gain in the spring, and 10% of their annual carbon gain in the
fall, during the period when the competing native shrub Cornus racemosa was leaf-
less. Similarly, Jolly et al. (2004) used an ecosystem model to in vestigate how
changes in the length of leaf display (extending both the start and the end of the
growing season by 1 or 2 weeks) might affect the net producti vity of canopy and
understory species. Whereas productivity of canopy trees was hardly increased
under either experimental scenario (+2% and +4% for scenarios 1 and 2, respec-
tively), very large producti vity increases were predicted for the understory (+32%
and +53%, respectively). One reason for the modest increase in overstory producti v-
ity was that increased respiration during mid-summer largely offset any additional
photosynthesis in spring and autumn. On the other hand, the understory productivity
was enhanced directly by the increased light interception in spring and autumn, and
indirectly because earlier leaf-out resulted in the production of more foliage relative
to the base scenario, which further increased light interception throughout the entire
growing season.
With the above literature review providing a background, we no w use long-term
phenological data from the Harvard Forest to in vestigate phenological differences
between understory and overstory species in a temperate deciduous broadleaf
forest.

2 Harvard For est Case Study
2.1 Site Description
The Harvard Forest (42.54°N, 72.18°W, el. 220–410 m ASL) is located in central
Massachusetts, about 100 km west of Boston. The climate is cool and moist temper ate,
with a mean July temperature of 20°C and mean January temperature of −7°C. Mean
annual precipitation is 1,100 mm, and is distributed evenly across the seasons. The
soils are predominantly sandy loams derived from glacial till, and are generally
moderately to well drained, and acidic. Forests are dominated by transition hard-
woods: red oak ( Quercus rubra , 36% of basal area) and red maple ( Acer rubrum ,
22% of basal area) with other hardwoods (including black oak, Quercus velutina ,
white oak, Quercus alba , and yellow birch, Betula alleghaniensis ) together accounting
for 14% of the total basal area. Conifers include eastern hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ,
13% of basal area), red pine ( Pinus resinosa , 8% of basal area) and white pine
( Pinus strobus , 6% of basal area). Canopy leaf area index (LAI) is » 5 m 2 m −2 .
2.2 Phenology Observations
Since 1990, springtime phenology observations have been made (by J.O’K.) at 3–7 day
intervals from April through June. Bud break, leaf development, flo wering, and fruit
development hav e been monitored on three or more individuals (a total of 115
perma nently marked trees or shrubs) of 33 woody species. Budburst is defined as when
50% of the buds on an individual hav e recognizable leaves emerging from them.
Near-complete leaf development is defined as the date when at least 50% of the
leaves on an individual ha ve reached 75% of their final (mature) size. Autumn
phenology observations have been made since 1991 (e xcepting 1992). Weekly
observations of percent leaf coloration and percent leaf fall begin in September and
continue through complete abscission. Here we focus on two key dates: leaf colora-
tion (date when 50% of leaves on an individual are colored) and leaf fall (date when
50% of leaves on an individual ha ve fallen). All dates were determined by linearly
interpolating between adjacent observation periods.
The species selection (T able 1 ) includes both overstory trees and understory
trees and shrubs. All individuals are located within 1.5 km of the Harvard Forest
headquarters at elevations between 335 and 365 m, in habitats ranging from closed
forest, through forest-swamp margins, to dry , open fields. Beginning in 2002, the
number of species observed in spring was reduced. For nine species (red maple,
sugar maple, striped maple, yellow birch, American beech, white ash, witch hazel,
red oak, and white oak), complete spring observations are still conducted, and the
same observation schedule maintained. For an additional eight species, only bud-
burst is monitored. At the same time, the number of species observed in autumn
was reduced to 14 (red maple, sugar maple, striped maple, shadbush, yellow birch,

black birch, paper birch, American beech, white ash, black gum, black cherry, white
oak, red oak, and black oak). Our analysis here focuses on the years up to 2001, since
the widest range of species are available for these years. Howe ver, when evaluating the
complexity of budburst model structure that can be supported by the data, we conduct
a separate analysis for the 17 species for which data since 2001 are also available.
Phenology observations are ongoing and the complete dataset is available online
( http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/data/p00/hf003/hf003.html ).
Complete on-site climatological data are available for the period of study from
the Shaler (1964–2002) and Fisher (2001−) meteorological stations, located near
the forest’s administrati ve buildings. For this analysis, we use daily mean air tem-
perature (°C), calculated from recorded daily maxima and minima.
2.3 Phenology Models
A variety of different models hav e been used to model spring phenology of temper ate
species (e.g., Hänninen 1995 ; Schwartz 1997 ; Chuine et al. 1998 ; Chuine 2000 ;
Schaber and Badeck 2003 ; Richardson et al. 2006 ; note that models to predict
autumn phenology are comparatively less-well dev eloped, see Schaber and Badeck
2003) . To date, there is no consensus on which modeling approach is best. There
are a number of reasons for this. First, models that give the best fit for one data set
may perform the worst when validated against an external data set (Chuine et al.
1998, 1999) . Second, the model that works best for one species may perform poorly
for other species (Hunter and Lechowicz 1992 ; Chuine et al. 1998, 1999) . Third,
models that are considered physiologically realistic (see discussion by Hänninen
1995) have sometimes been found to perform no better than simple, empirical
models (Hunter and Lechowicz 1992) . Fourth, a range of different model structures
can often provide equally good fits to the av ailable data (Hänninen 1995 ; Schaber
and Badeck 2003) , and studies with synthetic data show that biologically “incorrect”
models can be parameterized so as to provide good fits, and ev en to make satisf actory
predictions (Hunter and Lechowicz 1992) .
Here we use the long-term Harvard Forest budburst and daily weather data to
evaluate a range of models that hav e been previously presented in the literature.
The models provide a context for interpreting observed differences in phenology
among species and from year-to-year . A key question of interest is whether there
are differ ences among species (particularly with regard to overstory vs. understory
species) in terms of which model is best supported by the data at hand; from this it
may be possible to learn about how species vary in relation to temperature sensiti vi-
ties and thresholds.
The models we use are largely based on (but not necessarily identical to) those
presented by Chuine et al. (1999) , and our description and nomenclature follows this
earlier work (see T able 2 for a list of symbols). Model parameters are fit separately
for each species, allowing for species-specific biological responses to en vironmental
cues; the parameters to be fit depend on the model structure (see T ables 2 and 3 ).

In general, budburst is predicted to occur only when some combination of chilling
and accumulated warming (“forcing”) have been achiev ed (i.e., S c ( t ) ³ C* and S f ( t ) ³
F *). The state of chilling, S c , is the time integral (from t 1 ) of the rate of chilling, R c ,
which is specified as a function of daily mean air temperature, x ( t ), i.e. Eqn. (1 ):

Models differ depending on whether or not a period of chilling is strictly required,
either prior to or concurrently with forcing. In “spring warming” models (Cannell
and Smith 1983 ; Hunter and Lechowicz 1992) , there are no chilling requirements
and only forcing temperatures affect the timing of budburst. On the other hand,
three types of chilling can be specified:
Sequential: In the sequential model, forcing has no effect until all chilling require-
ments have been met. During a “period of rest”, the state of chilling accumulates from
day t
1
until the state of chilling reaches a threshold value, C *. At this point (day t
2
)
there is a transition to a “period of quiescence” and accumulation of forcing units
begins and continues until a threshold value, F *, is reached, triggering budburst.
Alternating: The state of chilling and the state of forcing both advance together
over time from day t
1
( t
2
is set to t
1
): above a threshold temperature, forcing degree-
days are accumulated; below the threshold temperature, chilling days are accumu-
lated (thus forcing occurs whenever chilling is not occurring, and vice versa).
Requirements for chilling and forcing thresholds C * and F * are not specified
explicitly: rather, as more chilling is accumulated, the forcing required for budb urst
is reduced (when b < 0), here as in Eqn. ( 3 ):
()
*e x p ( )
c
F a bS y = (3)
Parallel: Similar to the alternating model, in the parallel model forcing and chilling
advance together over time, and as more chilling is accumulated, the forcing
requirement for budburst is reduced. Howe ver, unlike the alternating model, forcing
need not occur whenever chilling is not occurring. W e distinguish two versions of
parallel chilling. In the first (Parallel1), a threshold value of chilling, C *, must first
be reached before forcing units are accumulated (i.e., the model requires a transition
from rest to quiescence). In the second (Parallel2), chilling and forcing both accu mulate
from t
1
(i.e., t
2
is set to t
1
). (Note that as described here, both sequential and alter-
nating chilling are essentially restricted versions of the parallel model. For more a
more thorough treatment of chilling, see: Cannell and Smith 1983 ; Hunter and
Lechowicz 1992 ; Kramer 1994 ; Chuine et al. 1998, 1999) .
For each of these different model structures (Spring warming, Sequential,
Alternating or Parallel), various functional forms of the equations for R
c
and R
f
are
possible. Here we consider two variants. In one approach (here denoted CF1), the
state of chilling is specified in terms of “chilling days, ” which are accumulated as
R
c
= 1 where x ( t ) < T
chill
and R
c
= 0 otherwise, and the state of forcing is specified
100 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
in terms of “forcing degree-days, ” which are accumulated as R
f
= x ( t )- T
force
where
x ( t ) > T
force
and R
f
= 0 otherwise. In another approach (here denoted CF2), rates of
chilling and forcing are both specified as nonlinear functions of x(t) (Sarvas 1974 in
Chuine et al. 1999). More specifically , in CF2, (unitless) chilling is accumulated
accord ing to the triangular function in Eqn. ( 4 ):

The way in which these submodels are combined, and the parameters that are
optimized for each model, are listed in T able 3 . The resulting models vary both in
complexity and in their underlying assumptions about the nature of the physiological
processes involved, as manifest in terms of general model structure (e.g., the nature
of chilling requirements and tradeoffs between S c and F *), functional form (CF1 vs.
CF2), and the number of free parameters to be optimized.
2.4 Model Parameterization
Nonlinearities and discontinuities in phenology models (e.g., degree day accumula-
tion begins on a particular day , above a particular temperature) mean there is a very
real possibility of model parameter sets which yield only locally, and not globally ,
optimal agreement between model and data (e.g., Chuine et al. 1998) . Our parameter
optimization method was based on simulated annealing-type routines using Monte
Carlo techniques (Metropolis et al. 1953) as described by Press et al. (1992) and
used previously to estimate phenology model parameters by Chuine et al. (1998) .
FORTRAN code for the models and optimization algorithm is a vailable from A.D.R.
2.5 Model Selection Criteria
An objective method is needed to select the most appropriate model from among a
range of competing structures. While possible options include F -tests and within-
sample or out-of-sample cross-validation methods, alternative approaches based on
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 101
information theory are becoming popular in many fields, including ecology . For
example, Akaike’ s (1973) criterion is rigorously based on the expected Kullback-
Liebler information of each model (for a full overview of Akaike’ s method, as well
as many examples from the ecological literature, see Burnham and Anderson
2002) . Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) quantif ies how well the data at hand
support various candidate models. Assuming Gaussian errors with constant vari-
ance, AIC is typically calculated as in Eqn. ( 6 ):
2
AIC log( ) 2 np s =+
(6)
Here, n is the number of observations, p is the number of fit parameters plus one,
and s 2 is the residual sum of squares divided by n . The model with the lowest AIC
is considered the best model, given the data at hand, but it is important to note that
AIC is not in any sense a formal or statistical hypothesis test (Anderson et al. 2000) .
For a given data set and a set of candidate models, AIC ef fectively balances
improving explanatory power (lo wer s 2 ) against increasing complexity (larger p ).
In this way, AIC selects against models with an e xcessive number of parameters.
Alternatives to AIC have been de veloped (e.g., Schwartz 1978 , Hurvich and Tsai
1990) , and while we will not discuss these here, we will apply a correction factor
which has been developed for cases where n is small relative to p . The small-
sample corrected criterion, AIC
C , is calculated (Burnham and Anderson 2002 ;
Motulsky and Christopoulos 2003) as in Eqn. ( 7 ):
C

AIC AIC 1
pp
np

−− (7)
The absolute difference in AIC
C scores between two models can be used to evaluate
the weight of evidence in support of one model (the model with the lower AIC
C ) over
another model (Burnham and Anderson 2002) : if the difference, D AIC C , is small or zero,
then both models are essentially equally likely to be the best model. If D AIC C » 2.0,
then the model with the lower AIC
C is almost three times more likely to be best. If,
however , D AIC C » 6.0, then the model with the lower AIC
C is about 20 times more
likely to be best. Here we calculate D AIC C relative to the “best” model (lowest
AIC
C ) for each species, and express all AIC-based results in terms of this metric.
3 Results
3.1 Patterns of V ariation Among Species
For both canopy and understory species, budburst dates varied by roughly 6 weeks
among species (Fig. 2 ; four-letter species codes are reported here in the text to
facilitate figure interpretation; full species information is listed in T able 1 ). Among
canopy species, black cherry (PRSE) had the earliest mean budburst date (day 110),
while white pine (PIST) had the latest (day 157). Among understory species, red
102 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
elderberry (SAPU) had the earliest mean budburst date (day 105) and sheep laurel
(KAAN) the latest (day 144). The date when leaves reached 75% of final size v aried
by a similar amount for canopy species (48 days, from day 134 for trembling aspen,
POTR, to day 182 for white pine). Howe ver, the range of variation was only half
as great for understory species (25 days, from day 141 for hobblebush, VIAL, to
day 166 for mountain laurel, KALA).

Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 103
The time required for leaf expansion (i.e., the number of days between budburst and
when leaves reached 75% of final size) v aried by roughly twofold. For canopy species,
expansion took between 14 days (American beech, F AGR) and 32 days (black cherry),
compared to between 18 days (azalea, RHSP) and 40 days (red elderberry) for
under story species. For understory ( r = −0.67, P < 0.01), but not canopy ( r = 0.01,
P = 0.97), species, the time required for expansion was negatively correlated with
budburst date; in other words, leaf dev elopment progressed more slowly in early-
leafing species than late-leafing species, which may be a result of degree-days
accumulating more slowly in early spring compared to late spring.
There was a general tendency for budburst of understory species to be earlier than
that of canopy species. In fact, budburst of 13 of 17 understory species occurred prior
to the mean canopy budburst date. The only exceptions were the relati vely late-leafing
species maleberry, azalea, mountain laurel, and sheep laurel, tw o of which are ever-
green species (mountain laurel and sheep laurel). The average budburst date for
understory species was day 124, compared to day 130 for canopy species (day 120
and 126, respectively , when only deciduous species are considered). This pattern was
consistent over time, with the difference alw ays 3 days or greater (Fig. 3 ), and a
paired (i.e., mean for understory species vs. mean for canopy species, paired by year)
t -test indicated that this difference was statistically significant ( P < 0.001; results
were unchanged when only deciduous species considered).
By comparison, the date when leaves reached 75% of final size differed little
between canopy and understory species. The average date at which leav es reached
this phenophase was day 150 for understory species, which was within a day of that
for the canopy species. A t -test indicated no statistically significant difference
between canopy and understory species ( P = 0.30; the same pattern was observed
when analysis was limited to the deciduous species).
The date of leaf coloration varied by less than 3 weeks among canopy species,
but by almost a full week more among understory species (Fig. 4 ). Among canopy
species, red maple (ACR U) had the earliest mean leaf coloration date (day 274),
while trembling aspen (POTR) the latest (day 292). Among understory species,
azalea (RHSP) had the earliest mean leaf coloration date (day 272) while winter-
berry (IL VE) had the latest (day 295). Thus both the earliest and latest species in
terms of leaf coloration date tended to be understory species, although this was not
the case in every year (e.g., PO TR was in a number of years the latest species).
Whereas in the spring there was a strong tendency , particularly among understory
species, to change rank order between budburst and when leaves reached 75% of
final size (Fig. 2 ), in autumn the species order of leaf coloration and leaf fall was
more consistent. For example, the earliest and latest species for leaf fall were the
same as those for leaf coloration for both groups of species. Furthermore, the rank
correlation between dates of leaf coloration and leaf fall was higher (Spearman rank
correlation, ρ = 0.95) than between budburst date and the date when leaves reached
75% of final size ( ρ = 0.81).
There was a slight tendency for dates of leaf coloration and leaf fall of understory
species to be later than that of canopy species. The average leaf coloration date for
canopy species was day 280, compared to day 281 for understory species; the
104 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
aver age leaf fall dates were days 289 and 291, respectively . Although small, these
differences were consistent from year to year (Fig. 5 ; date of leaf coloration dif ference
statistically significant at P = 0.01 by paired t-test, date of leaf fall dif ference statis-
tically significant at P < 0.001; comparable results, except both differences signif icant
at P < 0.001, were observed when analysis was limited to the deciduous species).
However , for only 7 of 17 understory was leaf coloration date after the mean date
for canopy species, and for only nine understory species was leaf fall date after the
Fig. 5 Autumn phenology of understory and canopy species at the Harvard Forest, 1993–2001.
Leaf coloration (LC) is date when 50% of leaves are colored ( hollow symbols ); leaf fall (LF) is

species in each class (16 canopy species, 17 understory species).

mean date for canopy species. Thus, while these patterns are statistically significant,
they may not have great biological or ecological significance, and certainly do not
indicate large differences in autumn phenology between broad groups of canopy
and understory species. Rather, the differences are more pronounced among
indi vidual species within each group.
3.2 Differences Between Canopy and Conspecific
Understory Trees
For six species (sugar maple, ACSA; black birch, BELE; paper birch, BEP A; gray
birch, BEPO; American beech, FA GR; and black cherry, PRSE; see T able 1 ), one or
more individuals of each was classified as either dominant or codominant (here,
lumped together as “canopy trees”), and one or more individuals was classified as
suppressed (here, “understory trees”). For each of these species we calculated, by year,
the difference in date at which the canopy and understory trees reached each pheno-
logical stage, and then conducted a simple two-tailed t -test on these differences.

A positive value indicates that canopy indi viduals reach that phenophase at a later date than under-
story individuals. ( a ) Budburst (BB); ( b ) leaves reached 75% of final size (L75); ( c ) leaf coloration
(LC); ( d ) leaf fall (LF). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals on the mean difference, with
each year treated as a replicate.
106 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
These results indicate that whereas understory sugar maple and paper birch
reached budburst significantly (P < 0.05) earlier than canopy trees of the same
species, the reverse was true for black birch and American beech (Fig. 6a ).
These dif ferences lar gely disappeared as foliar development proceeded: only for
sugar maple was there still a significant (P < 0.05) difference between canopy and
understory conspecifics in the date when leaves reached 75% of f inal size (Fig. 6b ).
In autumn, dates of leaf coloration and leaf fall for below-canopy sugar maple
and American beech were both significantly (P < 0.05) later than canopy trees of
the same species, whereas understory black birch, paper birch, and gray birch all
dropped their leaves significantly (P < 0.05) earlier than canopy trees of the same
species (Fig. 6c , d ). For black cherry, there was no consistent dif ference in spring
or autumn phenology between canopy and understory individuals.
3.3 Interannual V ariation and Consistency of Species Ordering
The above patterns of phenological variation among species were largely consistent
from year-to-year, particularly for b udburst. For example, there was a very strong
correlation in budburst date between all pairs of years (Pearson correlation, average
r = 0.94; range r = 0.87 to r = 0.98), and the sequence in which budburst occurred
out was also highly consistent (Spearman rank correlation, average ρ = 0.92, range
ρ = 0.77–0.98). A similar degree of consistency showed up comparing the date
when leaves reached 75% of final size for early and late springs (r = 0.98, ρ = 0.95),
and, to a slightly lesser degree, for dates of leaf coloration and leaf fall comparing
early and late autumns (both r = 0.93, ρ = 0.92).
An analysis of variance on the 1990–2001 data set, with “species” and “year” as
main effects, suggested that there is more variation among species ( ~ 65–80% of
total variance) than there is across years ( ~ 20% of total variance for budburst date
and the date when leaves reached 75% of final size, ~ 5% for dates of leaf coloration
and leaf fall). For the spring measures, the residual variance (which includes the
unaccounted for species × year interaction effect) was small (<10%) corroborating
the above conclusion that the species patterns are more or less consistent from year-
to-year. On the other hand, the residual v ariance for the autumn measures was large,
~ 25%, which suggests that the species patterns in autumn are somewhat less consistent
(or less predictable) from year-to-year.

number of species: for example, the Alternating CF1 and Sequential CF1 models
were indicated to be the best model for eight and nine species, respectively .
However , the most highly parameterized model, Parallel1 CF1, with six parameters
and the lowest RMSE, was not identified by AIC
C
to be the best model for any of
the 33 species. Simply put, with time series of only 12 years in length, a model with
six parameters cannot be justified, because the penalty associated with additional
parameters is larger than the associated improvement in model fit (e ven with 17
years of data, a model with five parameters would ha ve to fit the data twice as well
as a model with two parameters for the models to have the same AIC
C
value).
Models with D AIC C
less than 2 are still considered to be reasonably well-
supported by the data (Burnham and Anderson 2002) . For the Spring warming CF2
model, D AIC C
was £ 2 for 22 species (and £ 6, which might be considered the limit
at which a claim could be made that the data give any support for the model, for 29
species) (T able 4 ). No other model had D AIC C
£ 2 for more than 14 species; but the
Spring warming CF1 and Alternating CF1 models both had D AIC C
£ 6 for more
than three quarters of all species.
These patterns did not differ markedly between canopy and understory species;
in both instances, the Spring warming CF2 model was identified as the best model
for at least six species, and the patterns of variation in support for other models was
comparable for both groups of species (summary results not shown). There was no
obvious relationship between the timing of budburst (i.e., early vs. late leafing
species) and the way in which models were ranked by AIC
C
.
For the subset of species for which budburst observations ha ve continued since
2001, we conducted a similar analysis on the 17-year data set (1990–2006) to inves-
tigate whether additional model complexity could be justified if longer time series
were used for model fitting. Again, the Spring warming CF2 model had the lowest
AIC
C
for the largest number of species (7 of 17), and the Spring warming CF1 and
Alternating CF1 models were at least marginally supported by the data for most species
(T able 5 ). However, the f ive-parameter Parallel1 CF2 model and, to an even greater
degree, the four-parameter Parallel2 CF2 model ( D AIC C
£ 2 for 10 of 17 species), both
emerged as viable candidate models in this analysis. This anaysis indicated greater
support for the CF2, compared to CF1, formulations for rates of chilling and forcing:
for the Spring warming, Sequential, Parallel1 and Parallel2 models, AIC
C
values
were consistently (75% of all species, on average) lower for CF2 than CF1 v ersions.
4 Discussion
4.1 Do Canopy and Understory Species Differ Phenologically?
The Harvard Forest phenology data show (Figs. 2 and 4 ) that in both spring and fall,
there is a continuum of phenological activity , from “early” to “late” species.
Interestingly, the range of v ariation is not markedly different for understory and
canopy species. Moreover , on the surface, we do not see strong evidence of any
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 109
clearly-defined groups of species (either understory or canopy) that exhibit
dramati cally different phenological patterns in either spring or fall.
However, budb urst of 13 of 17 understory species occurred prior to the
mean bud b urst date of the 16 canopy species (day 130). These differences between
understory and canopy species had largely disappeared by the date when leaves
reached 75% of their final size. In the autumn, both leaf coloration and leaf fall
tended to consistently occur later in understory species than canopy species, but the
difference in mean dates between groups of species was suff iciently small (1–2 days)
as to be of questionable ecological significance. These patterns are broadly consistent
with previously published studies (e.g., Gill et al. 1998 ; Augspurger et al. 2005 ; but
see Barr et al. 2004) .

In 10 of 17 understory species, budburst occurred prior to day 125 (species
SAPU, red elderberry, through HA VI, witch hazel, in Fig. 2 ), whereas none of the
five most dominant canopy species reach b udburst until this date (yellow birch is
the first, on day 125; but the most abundant species, red oak, does not reach b ud-
burst until day 129). Thus, these ten species are candidates for being classified as
having adopted strategies of springtime phenological escape – but clearly the suc-
cess with which this strategy is adopted (in terms of the potential increases in light
interception and photosynthetic assimilation) varies among species, with the ben-
efit potentially being considerably larger to the earliest species, such as red elder-
berry, compared to late b udburst species, such as witch hazel. As noted above,
however , the realized gains depend on the rate at which photosynthetic capacity is
developed following leaf-out, and note that understory species tended to progress
more slowly from budburst to 75% of f inal size, which could imply slow develop-
ment of photosynthetic capacity as well.
Three understory species (striped maple, winterberry , and chestnut) leaf out
between day 125 and day 130, i.e. concurrently with the majority of canopy spe-
cies, and appear not to rely on the escape strategy . Special mention should be made
of striped maple, which is known to be extremely shade tolerant, and chestnut,
which was a dominant overstory tree across much of the eastern United States until
the arrival of the chestnut blight in the early 1900s. Chestnut is now essentially
restricted to root-sprouted saplings and small trees in the forest understory. It could
be argued that chestnut would more appropriately be classified as a canopy species,
but this would not change our overall interpretation of the patterns reported here.
Two of the four understory species with especially late b udburst, mountain laurel
(KALA) and sheep laurel (KAAN), are evergreen species that would presumably
benefit little from early budburst or delayed senescence, since they retain most of
their foliage throughout the entire year. In this manner , ever green understory species
are still able to exploit the spring and autumn high-light periods, and photosynthesis
at these times of the year is considered important for their survival (e.g., Lassoie
et al. 1983) . Interestingly, while these species are both characterized by late budb urst
in spring, they are among the earliest (e.g., mountain laurel) and latest (sheep laurel)
species to drop their leaves in autumn (Fig. 4 ).
In the autumn, the single most abundant species, red oak (QURU, accounting for
36% of basal area), is the third-last species to drop its leaves in this community
(Fig. 4 ), which would make an autumn strategy of phenological escape relatively
difficult for most understory species. On the other hand, red maple (A CRU) and
yellow birch (BEAL) are both among the fiv e most dominant canopy species but
drop their leaves very early (Fig. 4 ). These examples highlight the fact that during
the spring and autumn transition periods, the developmental state of the canopy is
highly variable across space. Thus the amount of light reaching any point in the
understory depends on the phenology of neighboring species (Kato and Komiyama
2002) . In this regard, the degree to which an individual plant in the understory is
able to opportunistically take advantage of spring and autumn high light periods
largely depends on the species under which that plant grows. Detailed measure-
ments to quantify the light environment experienced by indi vidual understory
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 111
plants, e.g., vertical profiles of leaf area index and clumping indices (and how
these, and thus f TPAR , v ary seasonally), would offer insights into the degree to which
a strategy of phenological escape is being successfully adopted.
Previous studies comparing phenology of understory and canopy species (e.g.
Gill et al. 1998 , Augspurger et al. 2005) have limited their analysis to a more
restricted set of species than was considered here; our survey giv es a broad overall
view of phenological patterns within a forest community . We see that in springtime,
there is a loosely-defined subset of understory species that appear to adopt a strategy
of phenological escape; most of the non-evergreen species follo wed this strategy to
some degree. Howev er, the difference between understory and canopy species at
Harvard Forest appears to be smaller than has been reported in previous studies.
For example, only two understory species, red elderberry and witherod (SAPU and
VICA in Fig. 2 ), had budburst that was more than 10 days in advance of budb urst
by any of the dominant canopy species. For the remaining 11 species that tended to
leaf out in advance of the mean canopy budburst date, the period of phenological
escape was generally very short, only on the order of several days, and thus the
functional significance of the strategy (and the role of phenological escape in struc-
turing the community) is not clear. This is a surprising result because it suggests
that the costs (or associated risks) of earlier emergence at Harvard Forest may be lar ger
than in other ecosystems where similar research has been previously conducted.
There are even less pronounced differences between canopy and understory spe cies
in the autumn. Both competitive and abiotic factors could explain this. F or example,
because the most dominant canopy species, red oak, is among the latest to drop its
leaves, much of the understory remains shaded until very late autumn, by which time
cooler temperatures, shorter days, and lower peak irradiances substantially reduce
the potential photosynthetic gains of autumn phenological escape.
4.2 Do Canopy and Understory Conspecifics Differ
Phenologically?
Previous studies have provided relatively consistent e vidence of earlier budburst,
but not necessarily later abscission, by understory individuals of canopy species
(e.g., Augspurger and Bartlett 2003) . Here, our evaluation of phenological differ-
ences between canopy trees and understory individuals of the same species indi-
cates surprisingly mixed results in both spring and fall. For example, in spring,
understory individuals of sugar maple and paper birch tended to reach budburst
significantly earlier (by more than 5 days in the case of sugar maple) than canopy
individuals, whereas the reverse was true for yello w birch and American beech
(Fig. 6a ). The pattern for sugar maple and paper birch is consistent with what would
be expected based on previous studies, which generally show that within a species,
seedlings, saplings and small trees leaf out in advance of mature canopy trees (Gill
et al. 1998 ; Seiwa 1999a, b ; Augspurger and Bartlett 2003) , presumably because
the potential carbon gains from earlier budburst decrease with increasing height.
112 A.D. Richardson and J. O’Keefe
The pattern for yellow birch and American beech is counter-intuitiv e, as this did not
occur in any of the 13 species studied by Augspurger and Bartlett (2003) , and Gill
et al. (1998) reported exactly the opposite for American beech growing in a north-
ern hardwood forest. The fact that differences between understory and canopy
individuals had largely disappeared by the date when leav es reached 75% of final
size (Fig. 6b ) is surprising, as Augspurger and Bartlett (2003) reported that full leaf
expansion also tended to occur earlier in juveniles than adults.
In autumn, leaf coloration and leaf fall of sugar maple and American beech
understory individuals was much later (20 days in the case of American beech) than
canopy individuals (comparable to patterns reported for these same species by Gill
et al. 1998) , whereas smaller but significant differences in the opposite direction
were seen for paper birch (Fig. 6c , d ). Similarly mixed results have been reported
previously in the literature for autumn phenology (Seiwa 1999a, b ; Augspurger and
Bartlett 2003) .
Within species, phenological differences between understory and canopy indi-
viduals have been attributed to vertical temperature gradients, with w armer ground-
level temperatures in spring promoting earlier emergence (Gill et al. 1998 ;
Augspurger 2004) . If spring phenology is indeed under environmental, rather than
developmental, control (Augspurger 2004) , then these apparently species-specific
patterns in the Harvard Forest data may be the result of microclimatic differences
among understory individuals due to variation in topography (Fisher et al. 2006) ,
canopy openness (Augspurger and Bartlett 2003) , or even the phenology of neigh-
boring species.
4.3 Do Species Respond Differently to Climatic V ariation?
Our results indicated that the ordering of species in terms of phenological sequence
was relatively consistent in spring (i.e., for budb urst date and the date when leaves
reached 75% of final size; see also Lechowicz 1984) from year-to-year, but somewhat
less so in autumn (i.e., for dates of leaf coloration and leaf fall). This may be partially
attributed to inherent uncertainties in the autumn measures, which are considerably
more subjective than well-defined phenophases, such as b udburst. The difference in
consistency between spring and autumn ordering may also be a function of differ ences
in species-level responses to en vironmental signals. For example, we might hypoth esize
that whereas all species are responding to similar temperature cues in the springtime,
in autumn some species might be responding to various temperature thresholds,
whereas other species are responding to changes in day length. In addi tion, drought,
as well as wind and rain (major autumn storms tend to bring down a large number of
leaves), are factors that affect autumn senescence and abscission, b ut possibly result
in more stochastic and less predictable patterns of autumn phenology.
Akaike’s Information Criterion indicated that the support for different pheno-
logical model structures was mixed and varied somewhat among species (T able 4 ).
Although there was no clear consensus model that consistently worked best (see
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 113
also Chuine et al. 1998) for all 33 study species (1990–2001 data), the data for most
species gave reasonably strong support for three models, with the Spring warming
CF2 model clearly the top choice. Both Hunter and Lechowicz (1992) and Chuine
et al. (1998, 1999) also reported that a spring warming model performed as well, if
not better than, more complex models inv olving chilling requirements. However,
whereas results of Hunter and Lechowicz (1992) indicated support for a model with
sequential chilling but not parallel chilling, results of Chuine et al. (1998) indicate
support for a model with alternating chilling but not sequential or parallel chilling.
Our results were mixed, differing depending on whether the shorter 1990–2001 (33
species) or longer 1990–2006 (17 species) dataset was being analyzed: the
Sequential CF1 model was well-supported by 14 of 33 species in the shorter data
set, but none of the 17 species in the longer data set, whereas the Parallel2 CF2
model was well supported by none of 33 species in the shorter data set, but 10 of
17 species in the longer data set. A possible explanation for this unusual pattern is
that climatic conditions (and the phenological response to those conditions) for one
or more years between 2002 and 2006 may have been suff iciently different from
those between 1990 and 2001 to be incompatible with the Sequential CF1 model.
However , as noted by Hänninen (1995) , rigorous testing of mechanistic phenology
models of the type studied here really requires experimental, rather than observa-
tional, data sets.
W e saw no evidence of differences between overstory and understory species, or
between evergreen and deciduous species, in terms of which model structure was
preferred. And, while Schaber and Badeck (2003) reported that the best-fitting
models differed between species with early and late budburst dates in German y, we
did not see evidence of a similar pattern in the Harvard Forest data. A possible
explanation for this difference is that none of our models explicitly accounted for
photoperiod (although, in spring warming models, the date at which forcing starts
to accumulate could be interpreted as a photoperiod cue), whereas Schaber and
Badeck (2003) found that day length improved model performance for species with
late budburst (but see Cannell and Smith 1983) .
Because similar model structures were indicated for most species, it could be
difficult to argue that phenological responses are dri ven by species-specific cues
(cf. Schaber and Badeck 2003) . For example, there was no evidence that one group
of species required sequential chilling, while another required parallel chilling,
while a third group responded just to spring warming. On the other hand, looking
at the species-specific model parameterization, certain species stand out as occupy-
ing distinct regions of multivariate parameter space. F or example, for the Spring
warming CF2 model, the understory evergreen species sheep laurel and mountain
laurel, although late leafing, did not appear to require more forcing than other spe cies,
but rather appeared insensitive to forcing until early May , whereas many other
species respond to forcing beginning in late March. For the Parallel2 CF2 model,
there were large and significant differences among species in the parameters a and
b, which control the degree to which the accumulated chilling reduces the forcing
requirement (strongly in some species, almost not at all in other species). Similarly,
the optimal chilling temperature, and the date at which chilling begins to accumu-

late, varied substantially among species. These differences in parameterization giv e
insights into biologically-based species-specific responses to the environment
(Hunter and Lechowicz 1992) , and thus why the sequence in which budburst occurs
might vary slightly from year-to-year . Furthermore, in the context of climate
change, these differences have implications for ho w species will respond to future
climates (Murray et al. 1989 ; Kramer 1994 ; see also Chuine et al. 2000 for an
historical analysis), and thus imply that changes in the order that species leaf out
can be expected. As evidence of this, we note that the species ordering was largely
consistent between “early” and “late” spring years (Spearman rank correlation, P =
0.98), but whereas budburst of gray birch was more than 9 days earlier in “early”
spring years, for hemlock it was only 3 days earlier. Although Kramer (1994)
reported that species with late-spring budburst tend to exhibit less interannual v ari ation
(and thus less sensitivity to climatic variation) than those that leaf out in early spring
(see also Murray et al. 1989), our results give only weak support for this hypothesis
in general. The correlation between mean (by species) budburst date and the stand-
ard deviation (by species, across years) of budburst dates w as in the expected direc-
tion (negative) but signif icantly different from zero only for understory ( r = −0.54,
P = 0.02) species. For canopy ( r = 0.10, P = 0.72) species, or all species together ( r
= −0.14, P = 0.44), the correlation was not significantly different from zero.
5 Summary and Conclusions
We conducted an analysis of the long term Harv ard Forest phenology record to
investigate dif ferences in spring and autumn phenology both among (understory
species vs. canopy species) and within species (understory vs. canop y conspecifics).
Budburst of most understory species occurred prior to budburst by any of the
dominant canopy species, suggesting a strategy of phenological escape, although
the period of escape was limited to just a few days for most understory species.
Phenological differences between understory and canopy species had largely disap-
peared by the time leaves approached full expansion. Furthermore, in autumn, dif-
ferences between understory and canopy species were less clear-cut; late abscission
by the dominant canopy species, red oak, would tend to make phenological escape
in this community a less viable strategy in autumn than in spring. Comparing
understory and conspecific canopy individuals, we found that the patterns depended
on the species in question: both earlier and later budburst, and accelerated or
delayed senescence, were observed. An evaluation of a range of dif ferent models to
predict budburst indicated support for both Spring warming models, with no chilling
requirement, as well as models featuring Alternating and Parallel chilling. Models
with Sequential chilling were not supported by the data. Although these patterns
were broadly consistent among species, analysis of model parameterization indi cated
some differences in how species respond to en vironmental forcing. These differ ences
help to explain the small year-to-year differences observed in the sequence of b udb urst
among species.
Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory 115
This study, particularly the contrasting patterns of support for dif ferent models
depending on whether the shorter (12 year) 33-species dataset or the longer (17
year) 17-species dataset was used, highlights the value of long-term, multi-species
phenological data sets, with which it is possible to ask both ecological (how does
phenology vary among and within species?) and biological (what environmental
cues drive phenological ev ents such as budburst?) questions. With ongoing efforts
to link diverse “types” of phenology – e.g., to understand connections between
phenology of above- (e.g., leaves) and belo w-ground (e.g., roots) growth, develop-
ment and senescence, and how these relate to the phenology of ecosystem processes
(particularly those related to the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and mineral
nutrients, as discussed in many of the papers in this volume) as well as feedbacks
to the climate system (surface albedo and partitioning of available energy to latent
and sensible heat; Morisette et al. 2009) – mechanistic understanding of the causes
of phenological differences both within and among species is of critical impor-
tance. Evidence documenting phenological changes in response to recent warming
trends (Schwartz et al. 2006) suggests that the value of these long-term monitoring
data will only continue to increase over time (Lovett et al. 2007) .

... Nevertheless, Landsat and UAV estimates of SOS were more similar (bias (NDVI) = −5 days, bias (GCC) = −14 days, n = 1) over the plot in which the understorey greened up after the dominant trees (Larch; Fig. 4), i.e., where the understorey did not contribute to the signal resulting from the early stages of bud/leaf development. Later understorey budburst, although not usual, has also been observed in other temperate forest ( Richardson and O'Keefe, 2009 ). The later greening-up of the Larch plot understorey could be explained by the high amount of canopy gaps in the Larch overstorey (even after needle expansion, Fig. S1), meaning that high-light conditions were available for a longer period of time on the ground; therefore, not justifying the adoption of a strategy of phenological escape ( Richardson and O'Keefe, 2009). ...

The monitoring of forest phenology in a cost-effective manner, at a fine spatial scale and over relatively large areas remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) appear to be a potential new platform for forest phenology monitoring. This article assesses the potential of UAV data to track the temporal dynamics of spring phenology, from the individual tree to woodland scale, and cross-compare UAV results against ground and satellite observations, in order to better understand characteristics of UAV data and assess potential for use in validation of satellite-derived phenology. A time series of UAV data (5 cm spatial resolution, ~7 day temporal resolution) were acquired in tandem with an intensive ground campaign during the spring season of 2015 across a 15 ha mixed woodland. Phenophase transition dates were estimated at an individual tree-level using UAV time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and validated against visual observations of tree phenology. UAV-derived start of season dates could be predicted with an accuracy of <1 week. The analysis was scaled to a plot level, where ground (visual assessment and understorey development), UAV and Landsat metrics were compared, indicating UAV data is effective for tracking canopy phenology, as opposed to ecosystem dynamics detected by satellites. The UAV data were used to automatically map phenological events for individual trees across the whole woodland, demonstrating that contrasting canopy phenological events can occur within the extent of a single Landsat pixel. This, and a large temporal gap in the Landsat series, accounted for the poor relationships found between UAV- and Landsat-derived phenometrics (R² < 0.50) in this study. An opportunity is now available to track very fine scale land surface changes over contiguous vegetation communities, providing information which could improve characterization of vegetation phenology at multiple scales.

... The seasonality of light availability is critical in determining the growth and survival of understory herbs, shrubs, and tree seedlings, mainly because understory plants typically exhibit a 'phenological avoidance' strategy (Uemura, 1994). Understory individuals extend their growing period by expanding leaves earlier in spring (Harrington et al., 1989;Gill et al., 1998;Seiwa, 1998Seiwa, , 1999aAugspurger and Bartlett, 2003;Augspurger et al., 2005;Augspurger, 2008; Richardson and O'Keefe, 2009) or initiating senescence later in autumn (Gill et al., 1998;Kwit et al., 2010;Fridley, 2012;Fridley and Craddock, 2015;Gressler et al., 2015) than canopy trees. The periods of leafless hardwood in April and early May and in late September and October are important for photosynthesis of understory white spruce (Man and Lieffers, 1997). ...

The regeneration of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc) is a core issue for restoration from secondary to primary forests. There is a lack of Korean pine regeneration in primary forests, compared to an abundance of regeneration in secondary forests. However, the mechanisms behind this mysterious phenomenon have not been studied. This study investigated seasonal understory light availability in addition to carbon (C) gain of un-derstory Korean pine, nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage of Korean pine in secondary forests, and the growth and survival of seedlings under manipulated light regimes. Understory light intensities in early spring and late autumn in secondary forests were significantly higher than in primary forests. The C gain of understory Korean pine occurred mostly in early spring and late autumn, whereas it was negative in the growing season (summer). Total NSC concentrations of Korean pine saplings increased between growing seasons, and decreased during the growing season. In particular, the NSC was dominated by a progressive increase in starch in early spring and by a peak in soluble sugar in late autumn. In this study, the biomass, NSC concentration and pool sizes, as well as survival rates, were positively correlated with light availability, revealing that the species is shade intolerant. The accumulated survival rate, examined in the autumn, was less correlated with biomass, but positively correlated with the carbohydrate storage in autumn. High light availability and positive C gain in early spring and late autumn are key factors affecting the growth and survival of understory seedlings. These two periods in secondary forests are crucial for the survival of seedlings by ensuring sufficient energy to live through the long-lasting dark summer. In primary forests, however, light availability was relatively stable across all seasons, especially in the leafless period, and insufficient through-canopy radiation, along with dense lateral closure, caused seedlings mortality.

In the growing degree days (GDD) model for plants, 0°C or 5°C have been empirically used as base temperature (BT) for the GDD model, without experimental determination. In this study, developmental periods for bud break and leaf opening of mizunara oak, Quercus crispula were determined by using samples from locations separated by 900 km, cut branches from central Japan and potted saplings from northern Japan. The samples from each location were then grown in growth chambers under the four constant temperatures in different years. The relationships between the developmental rate and temperature were determined, BTs were calculated by regression analyses, and the required GDDs were determined. Multiple regression was applied to compare model fittings for bud break and leaf opening. Observational data were fitted with a logistic curve to empirically determine the BT and GDD for bud break. Better fitting was obtained for bud break than for leaf opening, in the growth chamber experiment as well as in the multiple regression, probably because bud break was controlled by the GDD accumulation, while the rate of leaf opening was directly and exponentially influenced by temperature. The BT for bud break obtained by the growth chamber experiments varied from 0.09°C–4.88°C between the two locations, and also within one location by year. A large variation in the GDD accumulation was recognized in the field observation at each location. These results indicate additional environmental factors not included in the GDD calculation likely influenced the leafing phenology of Q. crispula.

Differences in leaf phenology between juvenile and adult individuals of two tree species in a seasonally dry tropical woodland

In temperate forests, juvenile trees anticipate leaf phenology compared to adults, thus avoiding shading and herbivory. This is also expected to occur in seasonal tropical forests due to intense herbivory and shading during the rainy season; however, the anticipation of leaf phenology by juveniles in seasonal tropical forests has yet to be demonstrated. Stem‐succulent species are expected to be prone to juvenile phenological anticipation because these species are able to use water stored in their stems for leaf flushing in the dry season. We investigated this hypothesis by comparing leaf phenology (bud break, leaf expansion) of juveniles and adults of two species with contrasting wood densities in the transition between dry and rainy seasons in a tropical dry woodland. We also investigated the level of light limitation that juveniles experience in the rainy season. Both species exhibited bud break during the dry season, but only expanded their leaves with the occurrence of the first rains. In general, the stem‐succulent species had a more precocious bud break; however, anticipation by juveniles occurred only in the species with more dense wood. Canopy openness was lower than in temperate deciduous forests, but the fact that the full expansion of leaves occurred only with rainfall indicates that bud break in anticipation of canopy closure contributes only to keeping leaf photosynthetic balance from going negative, and not to higher carbon gain. The importance of anticipated budding for escaping herbivory remains an alternative explanation in need of investigation.

Key Message Species-specific neighborhood identity effects such as competition reduction or facilitation can positively influence growth patterns of Fagus sylvatica at a given site, but are not strong enough to overcome fundamental growth–environment interactions of European beech. Abstract Competition and growth dynamics operating within multi-species tree stands are more complex than interactions within evenly aged monocultures. In three major geographic regions of Germany, we used electronic dendrometers to analyze the impact of neighborhood identity effects such as competition reduction or facilitation on the intra-annual stem growth patterns of Fagus sylvatica (European beech) on various time scales (day to year). Although not consistently significant, within the same study site average basal area growth relative to initial values was always higher at the ends of the growing seasons if subject tree beeches were exposed exclusively to interspecific competition. Weibull growth curves were fitted to rescaled dendrometer profiles. Analysis of the resulting Weibull scale (T) and shape (m) parameter estimates indicated the following: within the same growing area, initial growth trends of beeches in either con- or allo-specific competitive neighborhoods did not differ significantly, but subject trees exclusively surrounded by Pinus sylvestris benefited through extended duration of growth. These findings are reflected in the results for onset, cessation and total duration of wood formation calculated from inverse Weibull functions. Results of this study tend to confirm the assumption that interspecific interference induces higher daily stem growth rates of beech throughout the entire growing season. However, although particular species-specific neighborhood identity or mixing effects can indeed positively influence growth patterns of Fagus sylvatica at a given site, they are not strong enough to overcome fundamental growth–environment interactions of European beech.

Plant phenology – the timing of cyclic or recurrent biological events in plants – offers insight into the ecology, evolution, and seasonality of plant‐mediated ecosystem processes. Traditionally studied phenologies are readily apparent, such as flowering events, germination timing, and season‐initiating budbreak. However, a broad range of phenologies that are fundamental to the ecology and evolution of plants, and to global biogeochemical cycles and climate change predictions, have been neglected because they are “cryptic” – that is, hidden from view (e.g root production) or difficult to distinguish and interpret based on common measurements at typical scales of examination (e.g leaf turnover in evergreen forests). We illustrate how capturing cryptic phenology can advance scientific understanding with two case studies: wood phenology in a deciduous forest of the northeastern USA and leaf phenology in tropical evergreen forests of Amazonia. Drawing on these case studies and other literature, we argue that conceptualizing and characterizing cryptic plant phenology is needed for understanding and accurate prediction at many scales from organisms to ecosystems. We recommend avenues of empirical and modeling research to accelerate discovery of cryptic phenological patterns, to understand their causes and consequences, and to represent these processes in terrestrial biosphere models.

Temperate plants are at risk of being exposed to late spring freezes. These freeze events—often called false springs—are one of the strongest factors determining temperate plants species range limits and can impose high ecological and economic damage. As climate change may alter the prevalence and severity of false springs, our ability to forecast such events has become more critical, and it has led to a growing body of research. Many false spring studies largely simplify the myriad complexities involved in assessing false spring risks and damage. While these studies have helped advance the field and may provide useful estimates at large scales, studies at the individual to community levels must integrate more complexity for accurate predictions of plant damage from late spring freezes. Here we review current metrics of false spring, and how, when and where plants are most at risk of freeze damage. We highlight how life stage, functional group, species differences in morphology and phenology, and regional climatic differences contribute to the damage potential of false springs. More studies aimed at understanding relationships among species tolerance and avoidance strategies, climatic regimes, and the environmental cues that underlie spring phenology would improve predictions at all biological levels. An integrated approach to assessing past and future spring freeze damage would provide novel insights into fundamental plant biology, and offer more robust predictions as climate change progresses, which is essential for mitigating the adverse ecological and economic effects of false springs.

Vegetation phenological trends during last few decades have been frequently reported and these trends are commonly assumed to result from climate change. With the widespread influence of both human activities and natural processes, however, land cover and land use change (LCLUC) has dominated across various ecosystems in more than one-third of world's land surface. LCLUC could lead to changes in vegetation types and species composition at local to regional scales. Thus, we hypothesize that LCLUC can significantly influence phenological trends at an ecosystem scale. Here we tested this hypothesis in agricultural ecosystems composed of various crop types spanning the Midwest of the United States by analyzing satellite-observed land surface phenology from 1982 to 2014. Greenup onset dates in croplands occurred later at rates ranging from 0.18 to 0.67 d yr⁻¹ at the state scale. This trend was due to significant areal increases in corn (maize) and soybean that have later emergence coupled with areal decreases in wheat and oats that have earlier emergence, despite a trend of warmer spring temperatures that aid earlier crop emergence. Overall, considering the long-term directional change in greenup onset dates across these croplands, two-thirds was attributable to LCLUC and one-third to climatic variation. This finding indicates that extensive LCLUC can be the primary driver of satellite-observed phenological trends, especially in intensively managed agricultural landscapes.

Monitoring plant phenology is one of the means of detecting the response of vegetation to changing environmental conditions. One approach for the study of vegetation phenology from local to global scales is to apply satellite-based indices. We investigated the potential of phenological metrics from moderate resolution remotely sensed data to monitor the altitudinal variations in phenological phases of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Phenological metrics were derived from the NDVI annual trajectories fitted with double sigmoid logistic function. Validation of the satellite-derived phenological metrics was necessary, thus the multiple-year ground observations of phenological phases from twelve beech stands along the altitudinal gradient were employed. In five stands, the validation process was supported with annual (in 2011) phenological observations of the undergrowth and understory vegetation, measurements of the leaf area index (LAI), and with laboratory spectral analyses of forest components reflecting the red and near-infrared radiation. Non-significant differences between the satellite-derived phenological metrics and the in situ observed phenological phases of the beginning of leaf onset (LO_10); end of leaf onset (LO_100); and 80% leaf coloring (LC_80) were detected. Next, the altitude dependent variations of the phenological metrics were investigated in all beech-dominated pixels over the area between latitudes 47°44′ N and 49°37′ N, and longitudes 16°50′ E and 22°34′ E (Slovakia, Central Europe). In all cases, this large-scale regression revealed non-linear relationships. Since spring phenological metrics showed strong dependence on altitude, only a weak relationship was detected between autumn phenological metric and altitude. The effect of altitude was evaluated through differences in local climatic conditions, especially temperature and precipitation. We used normal values from the last 30 years to evaluate the altitude-conditioned differences in the growing season length in 12 study stands. The approach presented in this paper contributes to a more explicit understanding of satellite data-based beech phenology along the altitudinal gradient, and will be useful for determining the optimal distribution range of European beech under changing climate conditions.

We quantified leaf phenologies of saplings and overstory trees of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), and the shrub hobblebush viburnum (Viburnum alnifolium Marsh.) in a 72-year-old northern hardwood forest. Seasonal changes in irradiance in the shrub layer, and in the leaf CO2 exchange of viburnum, and sugar maple and beech saplings were also measured. Leaf expansion occurred earlier in the spring and green leaves were retained later in the autumn in saplings and shrubs than in overstory trees. During the spring light phase (before overstory closure), large CO2 gains by all three shrub-layer species occurred as a result of a combination of relatively large leaf area, high photosynthetic capacity, and high irradiance. Throughout the summer shade phase, photosynthetic capacity at a given irradiance remained relatively constant, but CO2 gain was typically limited by low irradiances. Even though irradiance in the shrub layer increased during the autumn light phase as the overstory opened, CO2 gains were modest compared to springtime values because of declining leaf area and photosynthetic capacity in all three species. The CO2 gains during the spring light phase, and to a lesser extent during the autumn light phase, may be important to the carbon balance and long-term persistence of saplings and shrubs in the usually light-limited shrub layer of a northern hardwood forest. Therefore, for some late-successional species, leaf phenology may be an important characteristic that permits their long-term persistence in the shrub layer of mature northern hardwood forests.

(1) The thermal times (T) (day ⚬C > 5 ⚬C since 1 January) to vegetative budburst were measured on fifteen woody perennials in Britain after different durations of chilling (C) (number of days ≤ 5 ⚬C since 1 November). (2) Late-flushing species, like Fagus sylvatica, had high values of T, even after 145 chill days, and T increased greatly with decreased chilling. Early-flushing species, like Crataegus monogyna, had small values of T, which did not increase much until there were fewer than 80-100 chill days. (3) Relationships of the form T = a + b exp (r C) were fitted for each species, which were then classified into five groups. Past meteorological records were then used to estimate the mean dates of budburst of each group of species at Edinburgh (26 m altitude) and Braemar (339 m) with 0-3 ⚬C uniform climatic warming. (4) Climatic warming did not markedly shift the date of budburst of any group of species at Edinburgh, so they flushed in warmer conditions and failed to exploit the earlier springs. However, at Braemar, the species with small thermal time and chilling requirements, like C. monogyna, flushed much earlier following climatic warming.

Predicting the Timing of Budburst in Temperate Trees

1. Four models for predicting budburst in northern hardwood trees, based on response to spring warming alone, or with the response to spring warming modified by winter chilling and photoperiod, were compared. An historical, 18-year budburst record, and artificial datasets with budburst dates generated according to each of four conceptual models, were used to analyse the abilities of the models to predict budburst dates. 2. The four models all gave better predictions than could be obtained by taking the average date of budburst of a species. The historical budburst dates were most accurately predicted by models based only on spring warming from a fixed start date, or from a start date determined by the satisfaction of a chilling requirement. A photothermal model was only useful for species with late budburst dates, and gave relatively little improvement over the average date of budburst as a predictor. 3. Analysis of artificial datasets, in which budburst dates were generated according to the biological assumptions of each conceptual model, reveals little connection between the ability to predict budburst with accuracy and the underlying biological response to temperature. This should be a general caveat to modellers; even biologically incorrect models can give reasonably good predictions of budburst phenology.

Phenological Differences Between Understory and Overstory: A Case Study Using the Long-Term Harvard...

The timing of phenological events varies both among species, and also among individuals of the same species. Here we use a 12-year record of spring and autumn phenology for 33 woody species at the Harvard Forest to investigate these differences. Specifically, we focus on patterns of leaf budburst, expansion, coloration and fall, in the context of differences between canopy and understory species, ... [Show full abstract] and between canopy and understory individuals of the same species. Many understory species appear to adopt a strategy of "phenological escape" in spring but not autumn, taking advantage of the high-light period in spring before canopy development. For all but a few of these species, the spring escape period is very brief. Relationships between canopy and understory conspecifics (i.e. individuals of the same species) varied among species, with leaf budburst and leaf fall occurring earlier in understory individuals of some species, but later in other species. We fit standard models of varying complexity to the budburst time series for each species to investigate whether biological responses to environmental cues differed among species. While there was no clear consensus model, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) indicated that a simple two-parameter "Spring warming" model was best supported by the data for more than a third of all species, and well supported for two-thirds of all species. More highly-parameterized models involving various chilling requirements (e.g., Alternating, Parallel or Sequential chilling) were less well supported by the data. Species-specific model parameterization suggested that responses to both chilling and forcing temperatures vary among species. While there were no obvious differences in this regard between canopy and understory species, or between early- and late-budburst species, these results imply that species can be expected to differ in their responses to future climate change.

Summary • Carbon gain during phenological avoidance of canopy shade by an understorey plant depends on the extent of avoidance, the leaf stage during avoidance, and whether young and old leaves can exploit greater light availability in spring and autumn. • For Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal., Aesculus glabra Willd., Acer saccharum Marsh., Lindera benzoin (L.) Blume and Carpinus caroliniana Walt. in a ... [Show full abstract] deciduous forest in Illinois, USA, spring avoidance with leaves at full size ranged from 0 days for Asimina to 24 days for Aesculus, and brought 36–98% of estimated total annual irradiance. Autumn avoidance was non-existent to minimal in all species. • Total chlorophyll reached maximum concentrations at the middle of leaf life span, and declined well before senescence. Leaf nitrogen concentrations and net photosynthetic capacity both peaked in youngest leaves during spring avoidance, and were low in old leaves during autumn avoidance. • Aesculus had especially high photosynthetic capacity during precanopy closure, while Asimina had relatively low capacity in its later developing leaves. • Young leaves of species with phenological avoidance can enhance C gain, while old leaves in autumn do not. Thus phenological avoidance in spring may enhance the persistence of understorey woody individuals of some species. Functional Ecology (2005) 19, 537–546 doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2005.01027.x

Phenology, the timing of recurring life cycle events, controls numerous land surface feedbacks to the climate systems through the regulation of exchanges of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. Land surface models, however, are known to have systematic errors in the simulation of spring phenology, which potentially could propagate to uncertainty in modeled responses to ... [Show full abstract] future climate change. Here, we analyzed the Harvard Forest phenology record to investigate and characterize the sources of uncertainty in phenological forecasts and the subsequent impacts on model forecasts of carbon and water cycling in the future. Using a model-data fusion approach, we combined information from 20 yr of phenological observations of 11 North American woody species with 12 phenological models of different complexity to predict leaf bud-burst. The evaluation of different phenological models indicated support for spring warming models with photoperiod limitations and, though to a lesser extent, to chilling models based on the alternating model structure. We assessed three different sources of uncertainty in phenological forecasts: parameter uncertainty, model uncertainty, and driver uncertainty. The latter was characterized running the models to 2099 using 2 different IPCC climate scenarios (A1fi vs. B1, i.e. high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vs. low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions scenario). Parameter uncertainty was the smallest (average 95% CI: 2.4 day century<sup>−1</sup> for scenario B1 and 4.5 day century<sup>−1</sup> for A1fi), whereas driver uncertainty was the largest (up to 8.4 day century<sup>−1</sup> in the simulated trends). The uncertainty related to model structure is also large and the predicted bud-burst trends as well as the shape of the smoothed projections varied somewhat among models (±7.7 day century<sup>−1</sup> for A1fi, ±3.6 day century<sup>−1</sup> for B1). The forecast sensitivity of bud-burst to temperature (i.e. days bud-burst advanced per degree of warming) varied between 2.2 day °C<sup>−1</sup> and 5.2 day °C<sup>−1</sup> depending on model structure. We quantified the impact of uncertainties in bud-burst forecasts on simulated carbon and water fluxes using a process-based terrestrial biosphere model. Uncertainty in phenology model structure led to uncertainty in the description of the seasonality of processes, which accumulated to uncertainty in annual model estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) of 9.6% and 2.9% respectively. A sensitivity analysis shows that a variation of ±10 days in bud-burst dates led to a variation of ±5.0% for annual GPP and about ±2.0% for ET. For phenology models, differences among future climate scenarios represent the largest source of uncertainty, followed by uncertainties related to model structure, and finally, uncertainties related to model parameterization. The uncertainties we have quantified will affect the description of the seasonality of processes and in particular the simulation of carbon uptake by forest ecosystems, with a larger impact of uncertainties related to phenology model structure, followed by uncertainties related to phenological model parameterization.

Seasonal temperature change in temperate forests is known to trigger the start of spring growth, and both interannual and spatial variations in spring onset have been tied to climatic variability. Satellite dates are increasingly being used in phenology studies, but to date that has been little effort to link remotely sensed phenology to surface climate records. In this research, we use a ... [Show full abstract] two-parameter spring warming phenology model to explore the relationship between climate and satellite-based phenology. We employ daily air temperature records between 2000 and 2005 for 171 National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration weather stations located throughout New England to construct spring warming models predicting the onset of spring, as defined by the date of half-maximum greenness (D50) in deciduous forests as detected from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer. The best spring warming model starts accumulating temperatures after March 20th and when average daily temperatures exceed 5°C. The accumulated heat sums [heating degree day (HDD)] required to reach D50 range from 150 to 300 degree days over New England, with the highest requirements to the south and in coastal regions. We test the ability of the spring warming model to predict phenology against a null photoperiod model (average date of onset). The spring warming model offers little improvement on the null model when predicting D50. Differences between the efficacies of the two models are expressed as the ‘climate sensitivity ratio’ (CSR), which displays coherent spatial patterns. Our results suggest that northern (beech-maple-birch) and central (oak-hickory) hardwood forests respond to climate differently, particularly with disparate requirements for the minimum temperature necessary to begin spring growth (3 and 6°C, respectively). We conclude that spatial location and species composition are critical factors for predicting the phenological response to climate change: satellite observations cannot be linked directly to temperature variability if species or community compositions are unknown.
