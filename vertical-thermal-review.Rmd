*(currently too long for NewPhyt)*

Rising temperatures are expected to have profound effects on forests; however, it is not well understood how responses will vary across forest strata.
Here, we synthesize evidence as to how environmental conditions and foliar traits vary across vertical gradients, shaping leaf temperatures, metabolism, and ultimately whole-tree demography and ecosystem function.
Strong vertical microclimatic gradients imply that canopy leaves are exposed to more solar radiation and higher evaporative demand than understory leaves, particularly in forests with dense canopies.
However, foliar traits relevant to shaping leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$) and metabolism also vary strongly across height or light gradients.
Resulting $T_{leaf}$'s exceed air temperature ($T_{air}$) under conditions of high solar radiation, low wind, and low stomatal conductance.
Differences are most pronounced when hydraulic limitations impede evaporative cooling such that $T_{leaf}$'s of sun-exposed canopy leaves become dramatically elevated above both $T_{air}$ and understory $T_{leaf}$.
While leaf metabolism generally increases with height across the vertical gradient, differences in thermal sensitivity, optimal temperatures, and thermal damage thresholds are modest.
The implications for tree performance are mixed: whereas thermal buffering may contribute to the disproportionate stress of larger trees during drought, emerging tree-ring evidence suggests that understory trees experience relatively greater stress from high $T_{air}$.
Additional research will be important for improving our spotty understanding of the thermal sensitivity of metabolism and tree growth across vertical forest gradients.
In the meantime, our findings imply that while large canopy trees are the most vulnerable to warming when combined with drought, understory trees may be more vulnerable under more mesic conditions.

# Introduction

**Forest responses and feedbacks to climate change will have a critical influence on the future of Earth's climate.**
Globally, temperatures have risen # $1.2^\circ$C since the 1850-1900 period [Rohde & Hausfater, 2020] and are expected to rise an additional #-#$^\circ$C by YEAR (IPCC 2021), accompanied by increasing severity and frequency of heat waves [@rohdeBerkeleyEarthLand2020] and hotter droughts [*Trenberth et al. 2014*].
These changes are expected to have profound effects on tree metabolism and forest ecosystem function (@breshearsUnderappreciatedPlantVulnerabilities; IPBES report), including altered rates of photosynthesis and respiration [@breshearsUnderappreciatedPlantVulnerabilities 2021; @corlettImpactsWarmingTropical2011], foliar damage during heat waves [@osullivanThermalLimitsLeaf2017; @corlettImpactsWarmingTropical2011], and reduced growth and elevated mortality during drought [@teskeyResponsesTreeSpecies2015; @breshearsUnderappreciatedPlantVulnerabilities]. Collectively, these impacts may lead to reduced forest C sequestration, as may already be occurring in some forests [@oishiWarmerTemperaturesReduce2018; @sullivanLongtermThermalSensitivity2020].The resulting feedbacks to the climate system, decreased C storage, and changes in albedo and hydrology will in turn have a critical influence on the future trajectory of climate change [@bonan_ecological_2016, Bonan 2008], yet this influence remains extremely uncertain [REFS].
 
**Rising temperatures are likely to have differential impacts on trees of different size and canopy position, in large part because small understory trees exist in a microenvironment that is substantially buffered by the more exposed canopy trees [@zellweger_seasonal_2019; @davisMicroclimaticBufferingForests2019].**
Forests are vertically and horizontally stratified, with trees of different sizes through various successional stages. 
Overstory trees form canopies that play a crucial role in moderating macro and microclimate [@ozanneBiodiversityMeetsAtmosphere2003; @nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017] by buffering extreme temperatures along with other macroclimatic conditions in the understory. 
This creates a vertical stratification of biophysical environmental conditions such as temperature, light, wind, humidity and CO~2~ that influences leaf traits, thermoregulation and metabolism along the gradient, with implications for whole plant performance [@fauset_differences_2018; @michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016].
Despite the fact that this vertical gradient inevitably shapes nearly every aspect of plant metabolism, demography, and ecology, we lack comprehensive understanding of these gradients [but see @niinemetsWithincanopyVariationRate2004a].
Importantly, this limits our ability to understand how warming temperatures will affect leaf-level metabolism, whole-plant performance, and, in turn, forest ecology and biodiversity, energy balance, ecosystem function, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions.


**Here, we review how the biophysical environment and biological form and function vary across the vertical canopy gradient in forests.** 
We focus on five key themes (Fig. `r fig_schematic`):
(1) the biophysical environment;
(2) leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$);
(3) the leaf traits that most strongly influence leaf temperature and metabolism;
(4) foliar metabolism, including stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, respiration, and volatile organic compound (VOC) production; and 
(5) size-structuring of whole-tree and ecosystem function.
*We then consider the implications for understanding forest responses to global change, including scaling across space and time.*

# Review of vertical gradients

## The biophysical environment

**The biophysical environment, defined here to include the physical structure of the vegetation and associated physical conditions, varies across the vertical gradient from the forest floor to the top of the canopy (Figs. `r fig_schematic`, `r fig_NEON_vertical`), with physical conditions in large part determined by the structure of the forest itself.** 
In this section, we supplement a review of the existing literature with a new analysis of data on vegetation structure and vertical microclimate profiles from the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON; Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`-`r SIfig_NEON_all`; Appendix `r appendix_NEON_methods`, Schimel et al. 2007].
While the focus here is on vertical gradients, it is important to note that in heterogeneous canopies with high gap fractions and large variation in tree height, or at forest edges, the biophysical environment can be more closely linked to the distance from the outer canopy than to height (Parker 1995). 

![**Figure `r fig_NEON_vertical`. Vertical gradients in the biophysical environment for six sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)**. Shown are  height profiles in growing season (a) leaf area density, (b) proportion light incidence, (c) proportion sun leaves, and July mean ± 1 standard deviation for (d) maximum photosyntehtically active ratiation (PAR), (e) maximum wind speed, (f) minimum humidity, (g) maximum $T_{air}$, and (h) maximum biological temperature, $T_{bio}$. Sites include a tropical montane broadleaf evergreen forest (Pu‘u Maka‘ala Natural Area Reserve, Hawaii; PUUM), a subtropical longleaf pine savanna (Ordway-Swisher Biological Station, FL; OSBS), two temperate broadleaf forests (Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, VA, SCBI; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, MD, SERC), and a mixed northern hardwood and coniferous forest (Harvard Forest, MA; HARV). Vertical profiles in micrometeorological variables (d-h) at all NEON sites are shown in Fig. S1.](NEON_height_profiles/figures/profile_all.png)

**Canopy foliage acts as the primary physical barrier between the atmosphere and the forest floor, buffering multiple aspects of the understory conditions. It is critical in influencing -- and is influenced by -- the vertical biophysical gradient (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).**
Foliage distribution is structured in correspondence with the distribution of tree sizes within a forest, where leaf area density (LAD; *i.e.*, leaf area per unit volume) patterns along the vertical gradient are heterogeneous across forests (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a-b, `r SIfig_NEON_all`). 
Dense canopy forests composed of broadleaf trees can have high LAD in the upper canopy layers, as well as in the understory (e.g., SCBI, SERC and HARV, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a) -- a pattern common in tropical forests [@ashtonComparisonsStructureMixed1992; @koikeCanopyStructureTropical1993].
In temperate forests, although LAD is generally more concentrated in the upper-canopy, undualting patterns are formed by conifers and top vs. bottom heavy foliage trees and sometimes by dense understories [e.g., SCBI, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a, @parkerVerticalProfileCanopy1989; @terborghVerticalComponentPlant1985; @ishiiExploringRelationshipsCanopy2004a; @parkerCanopyLightTransmittance2002]. 
In open canopy forests, including many needle-leaf forests, LAD can be predominantly accumulated in the lower canopy layers [e.g., PUUM and WREF, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a, @lawLeafAreaDistribution2001; @baldocchiSeasonalVariationEnergy1997; @bonan_ecological_2016; @ishiiExploringRelationshipsCanopy2004a]. 
Soil moisture conditions, topography, and gap formations followed by disturbance all alter foliage patterns and further influence the formation of relatively closed vs. open canopy forests [e.g., @almeidaContrastingFireDamage2016 ; @starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020; @bonan_ecological_2016]. 
In addition, seasonally dry and wet conditions, deciduousness, and phenology contribute to temporally shifting LAD patterns (Parker & Tibbs 2004; @smithSeasonalDroughtrelatedChanges2019 ; @parkerConsequencesEnvironmentalHeterogeneity2019). 
In this review, we focus on growing season conditions (peak LAD) unless otherwise noted.

**Light, specifically the proportion of incident light and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), decreases from canopy tops to the forest floor, with the profile shape modified by leaf area index (LAI), canopy height, canopy structure, and across species and forest types [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`b-d, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, @koike_leaf_2001].** 
This gradient is more pronounced under dense canopies, including broad-leaf and mixed forests (e.g., SCBI, SERC and HARV, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`d), than under more open canopy forests, including many conifer forests [e.g., OSBS, PUUM, and WREF, Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`d, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, @aussenacInteractionsForestStands2000a; Smith et al., 2019; Tymen et al., 2017; @chazdonPhotosyntheticLightEnvironments1984; @parkerConsequencesEnvironmentalHeterogeneity2019; @bartemucciOverstoryInfluencesLight2006; @baldocchiSeasonalVariationEnergy1997]. 
Variability in the light environment decreases with height, with the shaded understory being highly influenced by sunflecks, or brief increases in solar radiation caused by small canopy gaps and wind-induced canopy movements [@waySunflecksTreesForests2012]. 

**Wind speeds are also higher at the top of the canopy, owing to the effect of buffering with canopy height [@juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018].**
Wind speed increase with height across forest types from closed-canopy forests [@barnardSeasonalVariationCanopy2016; @mcgregor_tree_nodate; @juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018; @mullerEvidenceEfficientNonevaporative2021] to open savannas [@curtis_intracanopy_2019], including all 22 forested NEON sites (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`e, `r SIfig_NEON_all`). 
Specifically, across the NEON sites, July maximum daily wind speeds averaged up to 4.1 m s^-1^ higher at the top of the NEON vertical profile than at the bottom, where maximum wind speeds averaged $\le$ 1.1 m s^-1^ (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`).
The implication is that upper canopy leaves have substantially higher boundary layer conductance ($g_a$) and associated potential for loss of both water and heat (see next section).

**Atmospheric concentrations carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and water vapor can also vary across the vertical gradient.**
Atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations tend to be higher near ground level at night, associated with plant and soil respiration, but the elevated $CO_{2}$ quickly dissipates during the day [@koike_leaf_2001; @yang_spatial_1999]. Elevated $CO_{2}$ may benefit understory seedlings operating close to their carbon compensation point, but given that differences are neglible for most of day when photosynthesis is occurring, pattern in CO~2~ concentrations are unlikely to significantly affect the energy balance and metabolism of leaves across the forest vertical gradient.

Relative humidity, $RH$, tends to be higher in the understory and decrease with height across the vertical profile, although this trend is absent in open forests [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`f, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, e.g., @mcgregor_tree_nodate].
Dense-canopy forests maintain higher daily maximum $RH$ below-canopy than open forests and nearby open areas, and this effect is greater in wetter conditions, and warmer months [@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a]. 
In combination with $T_{air}$, $RH$ determines vapor pressure deficit ($VPD$) -- the driving force of water loss from leaves, which tends to be greater in upper-canopy and canopy gaps than in the understory [@fauset_differences_2018; @tymenQuantifyingMicroenvironmentalVariation2017; @niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004b]. Maximum $T_{air}$ and VPD in the understory are further decreased with increasing canopy height and LAI [@juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018]. *( This last sentence needs work.)*

**Air temperature, $T_{air}$, often shows little variation across the vertical gradient, but under certain circumstances it can be significantly buffered by forest canopies (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`).**
The $T_{air}$ gradient along canopies and understories varies with factors such as radiation fluxes, local topography, vertical air mixing, cloud cover and vegetation [*Defrenne et al. 2021*]. 
Typically, dense canopies buffer understories from maximum $T_{air}$ relatively more than open canopies -- *i.e.*, dense canopy understories can have cooler maximum daytime $T_{air}$ and warmer minimum $T_{air}$ during the night than open canopy understories or nearby clearings [*Defrenne et al. 2021*; @vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a; @defrenneGlobalBufferingTemperatures2019; @davis_microclimatic_2019; @zellweger_seasonal_2019; @ramboCanopyMicroclimateResponse2009]. 
Notably, this pattern can be reversed in open canopy forests or sparse stands, where below-canopy maximum $T_{air}$ can be warmer than canopy $T_{air}$ due to turbulent air mixing and thermal radiative flux from the soil and the canopy that is intercepted by lower-canopy layers, analogous to 'canopy greenhouse effect' [e.g., OSBS, Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`g, `r SIfig_NEON_all`b, @banerjeeExplainingConvectorEffect2017; @curtis_intracanopy_2019;@zweifelMiddayStomatalClosure2002; @hadleyInfluenceKrummholzMat1987; @ramboCanopyMicroclimateResponse2009; @hardwickRelationshipLeafArea2015].    

**The buffering patterns described above vary geographically, seasonally, and across forests types [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, *Defrenne et al. 2021*].**
The strength of buffering increases with canopy density -- for example, across gradients of elevation [@zellweger_seasonal_2019; @vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a; @juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018], moisture [**REF**], and proximity to water, for example in riparian forests [@davisMicroclimaticBufferingForests2019; @macekMaximumAirTemperature2019]. (*Nidhi, please make sure the references are appropriate here-- I rearranged the sentence structure.*)
Seasonally, canopy buffering capacity is greater in wet than dry seasons, presumably because leaf area is greater in wet seasons [@davisMicroclimaticBufferingForests2019; @rey-sanchez_spatial_2016; @vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a; @fauset_differences_2018; **double check these refs--at least one didn't belong**].

## Leaf temperature 

Leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$) is strongly tied to $T_{air}$, and is further influenced by the other biophysical drivers reviewed above and by leaf traits (see next section), with leaves adjusted to their environment so as to maintain, when possible, an optimal $T_{leaf}$ for carbon assimilation and metabolic processes [@michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015; @perezPhotosyntheticHeatTolerances2020]. 
Leaves can be cooler than air at high $T_{air}$ and warmer than air at low $T_{air}$ (limited homeothermy), and may sometimes be drastically warmer than $T_{air}$ (megathermy).
Often, however, $T_{leaf}$ tracks $T_{air}$ [poikilothermy, @cavaleriColdbloodedForestsWarming2020; @drakeNoEvidenceHomeostatic2020]. 


### Biophysical drivers

**Fundamentally, $T_{leaf}$ is determined by the energy balance of a leaf and can be estimated based on basic biophysical principles, where $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$ is a function of energy input through radiation versus heat lost to the environment [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`, @campbell_introduction_1998; @muir_tealeaves_2019; @michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016; @michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015].**
The dominant component of a leaf's energy balance is net radiation ($R_n$, including shortwave and longwave), and high radiation loads can elevate $T_{leaf}$ dramatically above $T_{air}$ (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`a).
The dominant avenue of heat loss to the environment is latent heat flux ($\lambda E$), wherein the loss of energy required convert water from liquid to vapour state cools the leaf. 
Evaporation ($E$) is controlled primarily by stomatal and boundary layer conductances, $g_s$ and $g_a$, and by the water vapour concentration difference between the leaf surface and the bulk air.
Therefore, $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$ decreases with $g_a$, which in turn increases with wind speed [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b,@daudetWindSpeedLeaf1999a] and decreases with leaf size (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`d);
decreases with $g_s$ (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`e);
and decreases with with vapor pressure deficit, or increases with RH (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`c).

![**Figure `r fig_leaf_T`. Theoretical expectations for variation in the elevation of $T_{leaf}$ above $T_{air}$ in response to (a) shortwave radiation, (b) wind speed, (c) relative humidity, (d) leaf width, and (e) stomatal conductance.** Leaf temperatures were modeled using the tealeaves R package of @muir_tealeaves_2019 parameterized to represent typical conditions for a broadleaf species (*Quercus rubra*) in a mesic temperate forest (Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA), as detailed in Appendix `r appendix_tealeaves_methods`. [ISSUE #6](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/6).](leaf_energy_balance/leaf_energy_fig3.png)

**Leaf energy balance is a tradeoff between water use strategy and optimum $T_{leaf}$ [@fauset_differences_2018; @kochDiurnalPatternsLeaf1994].** 
When $g_s$ is high, high $\lambda E$ facilitates heat dissipation. 
However, when inadequate water supply -- for example under drought -- causes leaf water demand to exceed water transport, conservation of water ($g_s$ limitation) occurs at the cost of increasing $T_{leaf}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`e, @fauset_differences_2018].
Therefore, while under maximum $g_s$, leaves can maintain $T_{leaf}$ closer to $T_{air}$ at high solar-radiation loads, but during $g_s$ limitation solar radiation can drastically elevate $T_{leaf}$ above $T_{air}$, especially for larger leaves [@fauset_differences_2018; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @pauTropicalForestTemperature2018].
With adequate water, species with smaller leaves (higher $g_a$) and larger $g_s$ will be most effective at cooling during high temperatures [@songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @dongBiophysicalHomoeostasisLeaf2017; @konradLeafTemperatureIts; @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @leuzingerTreeSpeciesDiversity2007].

**These basic biophysical principles shape the propensity for $T_{leaf}$ to be elevated above $T_{air}$ across vertical gradients in closed-canopy forests.**
High radiation at the top of the vertical profile (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) implies that canopy leaves have much greater propensity for high $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$, such that they would be expected to be warmer than understory leaves under most conditions (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`).
However, higher windspeeds and lower RH (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`), along with adaptive leaf traits that reduce $g_a$ and increase $g_s$ (reviewed below), give them lower sensitivity to intercepted radiation (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`a) and higher rates of heat loss (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b-e).

**Within closed-canopy forests, vertical gradients in the propensity for $T_{leaf}$ to be elevated above $T_{air}$ are expected to vary with micrometeorlogical conditions (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`).**
Under hot conditions, higher wind speeds and $g_a$ enable cooling, but at lower wind conditions, thickness of air layer at the leaf surface curbs rapid leaf-to-air heat transfer, limiting $g_a$ and increasing $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b, @martin_boundary_1999; @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @robertsStomatalBoundaryLayerConductances1990a; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020]. 
Thus, understory leaves, which typically experience lower windspeeds (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`), would retain more heat.
The higher-RH conditions of the understory (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) would also inhibit cooling, as $\lambda E$ is stifled under high RH, resulting in  greater $T_{leaf}$-$T_{air}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`c, @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @tibbittsHumidityPlants1979b; @perezIncreasingHumidityThreatens2018; @konradLeafTemperatureIts].
Thus, understory leaves can remain cooler under lower radiation load, but their environment is not conducive to shedding excess heat, particularly under humid conditions, and their tendency towards lower leaf $g_s$ and thermal capacitance can result in greater $T_{leaf}$ under slight heat stress [@leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020]. 
In contrast, under drought conditions (hot and dry, with higher-than-average solar radiation), when $g_s$ is limiting, there will be a propensity for $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ to be elevated more in the canopy than the understory (Fig.`r fig_leaf_T`).
Because sun leaves are exposed to higher irradiance and $VPD$, their $g_s$-limitation is steeper that that of shade leaves, resulting in greater increases in $T_{leaf}$ when $g_s$ is reduced [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`e, @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @fauset_differences_2018]. 

### In situ observations
**Following the principles outlined above, vertical microclimate profiles, leaf traits (see "Leaf Traits" section), and $g_s$ (see "Leaf metabolism and thermal responses" section) together explain in-situ $T_{leaf}$ observations (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`-`r fig_leaf_T`).** 
Often, $T_{leaf}$ tracks $T_{air}$, *in large part due to vertical gradients in leaf traits and $g_s$* / ~due to high evapotranspiration~, and therefore differs little between understory and canopy (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).
In closed-canopy forests, *including tropical and temperate broadleaf forests*, leaves experience greater $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ and higher maximum $T_{leaf}$ in the upper canopies than buffered lower-canopies, sometimes exceeding optima for photosynthesis ($T_{opt}$) and $T_{air}$, because of $g_s$-limitation and high radiation [@niinemetsShapeLeafPhotosynthetic1999; @doughtyAreTropicalForests2008; @fauset_differences_2018; @mauTemperateTropicalForest2018a; @millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021; @rey-sanchez_spatial_2016; @mauTemperateTropicalForest2018a; @rey-sanchez_spatial_2016; @pauTropicalForestTemperature2018]. 
In contrast, in open forests with lower buffering capacity, lower-canopy $T_{leaf}$ may be greater than upper canopy $T_{leaf}$, due to greater light permeability, *vertical air mixing*, and still air in the lower canopy and heating from the ground [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`h, `r SIfig_NEON_all`b,e, @mullerEvidenceEfficientNonevaporative2021; @martin_boundary_1999; @zweifelMiddayStomatalClosure2002; @hadleyInfluenceKrummholzMat1987;@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016]. 
Similarly, trees growing close to the ground can experience greater heat stress in their lower than upper canopies [@hadleyInfluenceKrummholzMat1987; @curtis_intracanopy_2019]. 
Greater $RH$ in closed-inner canopy can also increase $T_{leaf}$ relatively more than upper-canopy $T_{leaf}$ [@dietzVerticalPatternsDuration2007]. 



The extent of this buffering varies across forest types.
*Upper canopies of temperate-deciduous species can have greater $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ than tropical moist and wet forest [@mauTemperateTropicalForest2018a] and sparse canopies [@leuzingerTreeSpeciesDiversity2007; @pauTropicalForestTemperature2018], however in considering a broader range of forests, results may differ (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).* 
Because needle-leaves have lower $g_a$ than broad leaves, conifer canopies have lower mean $T_{leaf}$ [@leuzingerTreeSpeciesDiversity2007; @pauTropicalForestTemperature2018]. 

Spatial distribution of canopy temperature also shows that exposed tropical tree barks can be much warmer than leaves and flowers [@pauTropicalForestTemperature2018]. 

## Leaf traits 

**Leaf traits determine the capacity of leaves to thermoregulate [@michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016], and as such are critical to optamize leaf metabolism (see following section) across forest vertical strata [@michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004]**
Leaf morphology adjusts to the local microenvironment during leaf expansion [@zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004], and the ratio of direct to diffused light and associated water demands determines the differentiation of traits of sun and shade leaves [@casasSunShadeLeaves2011; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004; @keenanGlobalLeafTrait2016; @niinemetsLeafAgeDependent2016a]. 
This dichotomy in leaves is observed along the vertical gradient where canopy-leaves vary dramatically from canopy-interior and understory due to the differences in biophysical conditions (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`). 

~~~ *(this paragraph breaks the flow, and I'd love to be able to drop it or perhaps dramatically shorten. It is important and interesting content, though)*
Both biophysical variables (light, temperature, and evaporative demand; Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) and biological variables (tree height) play a role in shaping leaf traits. 
In particular, hydraulic constraints increase with height on a tree [@mcdowell_relationship_2011; @cobleLightAcclimationOptimizes2015; @couvreur_water_2018a] such that gas exchange is strongly constrained at the tops of very tall trees (e.g., ~100 m. tall *Sequoia sempervirens*; *Ambrose et al. 2009, 2010*).
Isolating height (>35m) from light shows that, canopy $gs$ decreases with increasing $VPD$  [@schaferEffectTreeHeight2000; @ambroseEffectsHeightTreetop2010]. Morphologically, leaf size [@jensenPhysicalLimitsLeaf2013b] and lobation [@kusiPlasticLeafMorphology2020] have been shown to decrease, and leaf mass per area (at greater than 20m) to increase, with height  [@cobleLightAcclimationOptimizes2015; @kenzoHeightrelatedChangesLeaf2015; @rijkersEffectTreeHeight2000a; @chinLeafAcclimationLight2017; @marshallFoliageHeightInfluences2003]. 
Disentangling tree-height related biological and biophysical drivers (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) of leaf traits remains an important area for further research, but is beyond the scope of the current review. Here, our primary interest is in how leaf traits and function vary across the vertical gradient from the canopy-top to the understory in forests. We note that patterns across light and height gradients are generally similar, at least in direction (Table 1), but likely to be modified by covarying biophysical constraints. 
~~~

Across the vertical gradient, traits vary (1) across sun and shade leaves within individuals, (2) across canopy and understory individuals of the same species, and (3) across canopy and understory species. 
The majority of studies characterizing variation in leaf traits or metabolism examine intraspecific patterns (categories 1 and 2), which are therefore the main focus of this review (Table 1).
However, when it comes to understanding and modeling forest ecosystem function, the relevant scale of variation is interspecific (e.g., *Lamour, Serbin in prep*).


### Intraspecific variation

Within-canopy, leaf traits vary along the canopy light gradient [*i.e.,* in sun and shade leaves, @casasSunShadeLeaves2011] at a leaf anatomical, structural and biochemical level [Table `r table_leaf_traits`, @sackHowStrongIntracanopy2006; @niinemetsWorldwideAnalysisWithincanopy2015; @chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020]. 
This variation shapes vertical $T_{leaf}$ patterns [@fauset_differences_2018; @michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016]. 
Further research to characterize trait relationships and responses through the vertical canopy is needed, because much of our understanding of trait coordination is based on the leaf economics spectrum concept (Wright et al. 2004) was developed using sun leaves [@chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020; @keenanGlobalLeafTrait2016]. 

Independent of light environment, traits also vary within species along the ontogenetic trajectory from the understory to the canopy. For example, LMA, photosynthetic capacity [per area] and $gs$ have been observed to increase with height, separate from light [@thomasPhotosyntheticDifferencesSaplings2002; @houterOntogeneticChangesLeaf2012; @cavender-baresChangesDroughtResponse2000].

#### Anatomical, Morphological and Physiological traits

Sun leaves in the exposed canopy have traits that help avoid heat and water stress than shade leaves where, for instance, being smaller, hairier, with higher vein density [@leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @vogelConvectiveCoolingLow1970; @sackHowStrongIntracanopy2006; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed200], and steeper leaf-angle [@niinemetsAdjustmentFoliageStructure1998, *REF*]. These traits [see Table 1] collectively aid heat dissapation and regulate $T_{leaf}$-photosynthetic balance. Whereas, shade leaves have traits that maximize light capture in the diffused-light environment with sunflecks, for example lower LMA, but are more likely to get overheated than sun leaves due to greater thermal capacitance [@mathurPhotosyntheticEfficiencySun2018a; @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @casasSunShadeLeaves2011; @schymanskiStomatalControlLeaf2013a]. In open canopies where light is comparitively homogenous, exposed leaves are primarily shaped by $T_{air_{max}}$ and $VPD$ stress, rather than solely by light [@mediavillaFoliarPlasticityRelated2019a].

#### Biochemical traits

Biochemical protection against foliage light and heat damage also increases with irradiance, and thus tends to be higher in the upper canopy than in the understory. 
Caratenoids and xanthophyll cycle pigments--violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin [$VAZ$]--can play a role in antioxidant scavenging and converting excess excitation energy into heat to reduce photoinhibition [@niinemetsPhotosynthesisResourceDistribution2007a; @mathurPhotosyntheticEfficiencySun2018a; @niinemetsAcclimationHighIrradiance1998]. This is also important for leaf acclimation to higher temperature if high temperature impairs the photochemical energy dissipation pathway  [Havaux, M. and Tardy, F., 1996]. Elemental traits, such as N and P differ with soil conditions, but $N_{area}$ typically increases in the direction of new leaf growth, where its allocation is optimized to prevent photoinhibition in leaves [@kitaoCanopyNitrogenDistribution2018]. Additionally, isoprenes facilitate higher heat tolerance in exposed canopies in species capable of emitting isoprenes, providing these species with a selective advantage in a warming world [*REF*].

#### Leaf lifespan and Deciduousness ("Lifecycle / ecological traits? ")


##### *Leaf lifespan*  

Leaf age affects vulnerability to heat stress independent of light environment [e.g. Marias et al. 2017], and has a strong effect on metabolism (Kikuzawa & Lechowitz, Kitajima et al.). Sun leaves have shorter lifespans than shade leaves, and thus upper canopy leaves are on average younger than subcanopy leaves, they therefore operate closer to their photosynthetic optimum . However, because leaf turnover rates of sun leaves in the upper canopy are faster than in the subcanopy,  damage does not really accumulate [Miller et al. 2021]. The effect of leaf age on heat tolerance once leaves are fully expanded and mature, is XXX. 

### Interspecific variation 

Widely, across forest species, the pattern of fundamental trait adaptation to light gradients is similar to within-canopy traits [@rozendaalPlasticityLeafTraits2006; @thomasPhotosyntheticDifferencesSaplings2002; @houterOntogeneticChangesLeaf2012]. However, trait plasticity can vary several-folds between  multi-species canopy and in understory species,  based on their inherent specie-specific traits and responses to environmental conditions. Spatio-temporal gradients, offer another axis for trait variation, for instance in early- and late-successional species [Ishii and Asano, 2007; @ishiiExploringRelationshipsCanopy2004a]. Therefore,  $T_{leaf}$ differs at an intra- and inter-specific levels with traits, where species with smaller leaves and larger $gs$ will be less vulnerable to temperature increase than species with larger leaves [@fauset_differences_2018; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020].

##### *Deciduousness*

Seasonal leaf-loss or -gain can alter biophysical and $T_{leaf}$ gradient in the forest [@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016]. Deciduousness in tropical forests is an adaptation to conserve water that is more common is dry than wet tropical forests. Within tropical species, the fraction of deciduous trees tends to increase across tree size classes, with understory species typically remaining evergreen [@conditQuantifyingDeciduousnessTropical2000c; Meakem]. In temperate deciduous forests, leaf-emergence is delayed with height-ontogeny, with understory species leafing-out earlier than canopy trees [Vitasse et al. 2013; @seiwaChangesLeafPhenology1999]. 

## Leaf metabolism and thermal responses

Leaf metabolism is strongly shaped by leaf temperature, and by the traits and environmental drivers reviewed above, all of which vary across vertical forest gradients (Fig. `r fig_schematic`). 
However, as we detail below, very few studies have valued temperature responses of leaf metabolic rates along a vertical canopy gradient, or compared sun and shade leaves (Table `r table_leaf_metabolism`).

### Stomatal conductance

Maximum $gs$ increases with light environment, and is thus higher in the sun exposed upper canopy than in subcanopy or understory leaves. However, because of the high evaporative demand and irradiance experienced by sun leaves,  mid-day stomatal depression is prevalent in sun leaves but not in shade leaves.  $T_{leaf}$ of sun leaves thus further increases due to the lack of transpirational cooling [@sanchesDifferentialLeafTraits2010; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004; @kochDiurnalPatternsLeaf1994b; @kosugiSeasonalFluctuationsTemperature2006]. Higher maximum temperatures influences leaf thermal sensitivity tolerance [Perez and Feeley, 2018], but exact mechanisms remain unclear. $T_{opt}$ of $gs$  did not differ significantly between sun and shade leaves in three tropical tree species [Slot et al. 2019], but sun leaves show a stronger decrease in gs to rising temperature than shade leaves (Hernandez et al. 2020; Carter et al. 2021 ). 

### Photosynthesis

**Photosynthesis is generally higher in exposed canopy positions-- a fact that is both theoretically expected and observed in numerous field studies (Table 2; Niinemets 2007 ; Kenzo et al. 2015 ; Slot et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020).**
This is primarily driven by the greater light available to sun-leaves. Photosynthesis increases with increasing irradiance, and saturates at quantum flux density of 400 $m^{-2}$ $s^{-1}$ to 700nm $m^{-2}$ $s^{-1}$.  

In response to the greater light availability, sun-leaves have traits allowing greater photosynthetic rates at high light under sufficient nutrient and water conditions, including higher concentration of Rubisco, and multiple layers of palisade parenchyma. Light saturation levels differ between leaves and canopies with leaves saturating at lower light level than canopies; while a certain amount of light saturates the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf, increasing the amount of light in the canopy may increase photosynthesis in the shaded part of the canopy.The vertical gradient in photosynthetic rates is also influenced by available concentration of N and P, and water availability.

Temperature can affect photosynthesis via direct and indirect pathways--directly, by altering photosynthetic enzyme activity and electron transport chain, and indirectly through increase in $T_{leaf}$ from $gs$ closure that is driven by biophysical factors [@lloydEffectsRisingTemperatures2008]. Photosynthesis has a peaked response to temperature, commonly found to be maximized at the prevalent ambient growing season conditions (Tan et al. 2017; @slotSituTemperatureResponse2017). Beyond the optimum, photosynthesis decreases as a result of stomatal closure and increasing $T_{leaf}$ (e.g. @slotSituTemperatureResponse2017; Smith et al. 2020 [temperate/boreal refs needed), and eventually due to biochemical constraints (@kumarathungeAcclimationAdaptationComponents2019a; e.g. Sage & Kubien 2007; Varhammer et al. 2015 ). Leaf heat stress at $40-60{^\circ}C$ can cause irreversible damage to photosystem [II], leading to leaf necrosis and eventually leaf death [Baker 2008; @feeley_thermal_2020].  

**We have very little evidence as to how the temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis compares between sun and shade leaves.**
Biophysically, we might expect sun leaves to have a stronger temperature-dependence and higher temperature optima than shade leaves (Fig. 14.5 in Campbell and Norman 1998; *revisit this!*; @niinemetsShapeLeafPhotosynthetic1999; @niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004b]. However, such a trend is not apparent among recent studies, where for 3 species in Panama, the optimum temperature for sun leaves tended to be slightly higher than that of shade leaves, but differences were not significant [Slot et al. 2019 ; @hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020]. Similarly, $T_{opt}$ of $V_{max}$ and $J_{max}$ didnot vary for tropical sun- and shade-leaves  [@slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019a; @hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020], and along the vertical gradient of tropical and temperate trees [@mau_temperate_2018; @millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021;@mau_temperate_2018]. 

@hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020 speculated that the lack of sun-shade differences in Topt may reflect acclimation to similar temperatures of peak photosynthesis. Sun leaves experience higher temperatures, but maximum temperatures are associated with conditions of mid-day stomatal depression, and acclimation to optimize photosynthesis at these temperatures would not be advantageous. Shade leaves that do not experience mid-day depression continue to fix carbon even when afternoon air temperatures peak. Evaluating this requires diurnal monitoring of net photosynthesis through the canopy.
 

**Leaf photosynthetic thermal tolerance (Tcrit/ T50)**

$T_{crit}$ is the temperature at which efficiency of photosystem II starts to decrease, based on chlorphyll a flourescence; and $T_{50}$ represents temperature at which the efficiency of photosystem II had decreased by 50% [Slot et al. 2020]. 

**Thermal tolerance (e.g., $T_{50}$) varies with exposure, but there are no studies isolating effect of height.**

In 1994, Knapp et al. showed that $T_{50}$ measured on chinquapin oak (*Quercus muehlenbergii*) growing in xeric, sunnier conditions was higher by $2{^\circ}C$ than bur oak (*Quercus macrocarpa*) growing in shaded mesic conditions. In both species $T_{50}$ also tracked increased from June to August. Within species, @slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019a found that $T_{50}$ was slightly lower for shade than sun leaves for two of three tree species measured in Panama.

Leaf thermal tolerances are more closely adapted to microenvironment than macroclimate [@feeley_thermal_2020; @slotPhotosyntheticPlasticityTropical2021]. Particularly, in an Australian arid region, *Acacia papyrocarpa* (Benth.) trees showed higher composite climate stress and greater $T_{50}$ in lower north-facing canopy than other canopy positions, correlating with low wind-speed, greater $T_{air}$ and longer leaf thermal time constants [@curtis_intracanopy_2019]. However, more research is required to fully understand the relationship between leaf thermal tolerance and microenvironments.

*We're not aware of any other studies on this."we may want to argue that we have no *a priori* reasons to expect thermal tolerance to scale with height per se (or do we?). I think it makes sense to expect variation with light exposure because of the associated differences in temperature you can expect the leaves to be exposed to, but height itself should not affect heat tolerance other than through associated traits perhaps"--Martijn Slot*

Across species, $T_{50}$ is explained less by phylogeny [Slot et al. 2021; Perez and Feeley, 2020a] and more by leaf traits. $T_{crit}$ was found to be greater among tropical species with large leaves that had slow heating and cooling time [higher thermal time constant] whereas $T_{50}$ was greater among species' leaves with greater LMA (greater construction costs), compared to species with low LMA [@slotLeafHeatTolerance2020]. @perezPhotosyntheticHeatTolerances2020 also found that, across species sun leaves that experienced higher maximum temperatures had higher photosynthetic heat tolerance. 

*If we take geographic gradients as a reliable proxy, we'd expect temperature sensitivities to reflect the environment to which the trees are adapted/ acclimatized.* Global $T_{50s}$ across latitude and climate range from ~45-50$^\circ$C (O' sullivan et al. 2017), where $T_{50}$ and $T_{crit}$ decrease with elevation among tropical forests and across latitudes [@feeley_thermal_2020;  @slotLeafHeatTolerance2020; @osullivanThermalLimitsLeaf2017]. 
 
### Respiration

**Similar to photosynthesis, respiration tends to be higher in canopy sun-leaves (Chen et al. 2020), but temperature sensitivity of respiration--$Q_{10}$--shows no definite trend along the vertical gradient [@bolstad_foliar_1999; Weerasinghe et al.2014].**

A few studies have found $Q_{10}$ to be greater in upper-canopy leaves than in shaded lower-canopy leaves, with significant differences among species [@turnbullScalingFoliarRespiration2003; @harleyEffectsLightTemperature1996], whereas @griffinCanopyPositionAffects2002 found that in Populas deltoides, lower canopy leaf respiration was more sensitive to changes in $T_{air}$ than upper canopy. Other studies have observed no difference in $Q_{10}$ across species vertical profiles and in seedling sun vs. shade leaves [@weerasingheCanopyPositionAffects2014; @bolstad_foliar_1999; @zaragoza-castellsDoesGrowthIrradiance2007; @zaragoza-castellsClimatedependentVariationsLeaf2008]. (*Martijn has some unpublished data on this that we might include.unpublished data showing higher Q10 in shade than in sun leaves for 10 species or so. May make sense to include here: https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/8.*). 
@xuSeasonalVariationTemperature2006 found that the canopy-position effect  gradient in respiration rates was much greater for Quercus rubra trees in mesic than in xeric sites, but the temperature sensitivity of respiration did not differ between canopy positions.

 
### VOC production

**Isoprene production**
High emission rates occur in the mid-canopy, and even from very small statured trees, at a site in the Brazilian Amazon (Taylor et al., in prep).
The high temperature carbon compensation point of sun leaves is higher in isoprene emitting species than in non-emitting species, so it is to be expected that other aspects of heat tolerance will be similarly affected by isoprenes (https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13564). Within species, isporene production scales with light and temperature; together and independtly?

## Size-structuring within the ecosystem

**Differences across forest vertical gradients in biophysical conditions, plant traits, and metabolism and its thermal responses scale up to affect whole-tree ecology and ecosystem ecology.** 

Vertical gradients in the biophysical environment shape which plant strategies, or sets of traits, are competitive in understory versus canopy conditions.

### Demography

**Vertical gradients affect tree recruitment, growth and survival, and how these respond to climatic variation.**
More interesting in this context is how these shape differences in the climatic sensitivity of growth and mortality. There are numerous demographic differences between understory and canopy trees, which have been linked to both the physical environment and plant traits (e.g., REFS), *and we will not review those here.* *(although maybe we should put one paragraph?)* Demographic differences between canopy trees and understory trees can also influence their their ability to tolerate multiple stressors. Tolerance of more than one biological and biophyical stressors can increase with tree height and light, enabled by non-structural carbon reserve [NSC], with smaller shaded trees being more sensitive due to lower NSC [@niinemetsResponsesForestTrees2010a]. However, growth also declines as trees age. This is partly because autotrophic respiration increases with age that declines NPP, whereas due to increase in morphological and anatomical complexity, GPP also increases [@IncreasingRespiratoryCosts]. Vertical biophysical conditions are bound to influence growth and whole tree functioning.

Greater $VPD$, atmospheric demand and low RH can be more stressful for trees, than soil moisture across biomes-including mesic forests,  as the former limits surface conductance and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture [@novickIncreasingImportanceAtmospheric2016; @corlettImpactsWarmingTropical2011; @ruehrWaterAvailabilityDominant2016]. Along with greater VPD, increase in temperature even under adequete water can cause greater tree hydraulic stress due to altered soil-water dynamics than milder drought, in temperate species [@ruehrWaterAvailabilityDominant2016; @parkwilliamsTemperaturePotentDriver2013]. Whereas greater $RH$ can do the opposite, stifling evapotranspiration and thereby increasing $T_{leaf}$ [Fig.3; @perezIncreasingHumidityThreatens2018; @tibbittsHumidityPlants1979]. Altered precipitation regimes can cause droughts, that are more  detrimental to larger trees than small trees, because limited soil-water cannot meet the evaporative demand via the long-distance water transport to the canopy [@bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015; @mcgregor_tree_nodate; @bartholomewSmallTropicalForest2020]. However, given adequate moisture to sustain high $g_s$, canopy leaves exposed to more wind and lower humidity should be more effective at cooling when $T_{air}$ exceeds physiological optima (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`).

Biophysical conditions can alter growth rates, but can do so differently between size classes through influencing existing demographic differences. Particulary evidence in in mesic temperate and subtropical eucalyptus forests shows that higher temperatures primarily reduced tree growth through altering water availability  [@bowmanWarmerWorldWill2014]. Whereas in tropical forests higher nighttime temperatures was associated with decelarating tree growth rates predominantly in smaller trees but also in taller trees [*Clark 2010; 2013; Feeley et al. 2007*], perhaps due to increase in nighttime respiratory carbon loss that reduced carbon availability for growth. 

**Recently emerging evidence indicates that understory trees tend to exhibit greater growth declines with increasing $T_{air}$ under mesic conditions.** 
In eight forests across the northeast United States, growth rates of understory trees declined sharply at higher $T_{air}$ [Fig `r fig_treerings` **???**; @rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory].
This pattern is initially counter-intuitive in that sun-exposed leaves can experience greater elevation of $T_{leaf}$ over $T_{air}$ than shade leaves (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T` **???**). 
 It is also possible that higher temperatures reduce understorty tree growth in these forests through an indirect mechanism, such as accelerated competition under warmer temperatures. In other cases, warming is associated with taller understory trees with lower LMA that complete their lifecycle under closed-canopy temperate forests [@maesPlantFunctionalTrait2020]. 

Phenologically, in temperate deciduous and mesic forests, understory growth can be more sensitive to annual warming than canopy, showing earlier spring onset and later autumn senescense [Zohnner and Renner, 2019].  However, later in spring, short-term heat waves can negatively impact partially-expanded canopy leaves, by inducing leaf shedding and decreasing photosynthesis and C uptake in reflushed leaves more so than in understory saplings that are buffered [@filewodImpactsSpringHeat2014]. Increase in summer temperature is also associated with reduced forest carbon storage [@oishiWarmerTemperaturesReduce2018].


*In this section we could perhaps also consider differences in biomass distribution between canopy trees an understory plants, and what that may mean for performance at high temperature. What I'm thinking is the temperature sensitivity of respiration that applies to leaves, stems, and roots, and even though thermal acclimation of leaf respiration is common, much less is known about acclimation of stem and root respiration, and incomplete acclimation still increases the respiration load at higher temperature. It is possible that an increased respiration load is more disadvantageous for understory plants because 1), I suspect that a greater fraction of their total biomass is life biomass that respires (as opposed dead heartwood in the stems of big trees), and 2), because they operate closer to their light compensation point, so if they lose more carbon in respiration, they would need  to make up for lost carbon in photosynthesis, but might lack sunlight to do so*

Current figure shows (a) drought responses as a function of height in a temperate broadleaf forest (SCBI), from McGregor et al. 2020; (b) responses to growing season temperature in eight New England forests, from Rollinson et al. 2020.  I'M NOT SURE THIS IS WHAT WE WANT, BUT I THINK SOME SORT OF TREE-RING FIGURE WOULD BE GOOD.

### C and water flux

*(here, it would be good to add some content on contributions to C cycling across the vertical gradient.  If Camille's paper is published ahead of this, that would be the best source. Meakem et al. 2018, New Phyt has a similar analysis for 3 sites.)*

Leaf-scale properties and processes aggregate non-linearly  in vertical and horizontal space, influencing stand-level ecosystem processes, and in turn biosphere-atmosphere exchanges of water, carbon, energy, and trace gases. As described above, variation in temperature across vertical gradients can interact with local light conditions and other vertically varying meteorological conditions to affect species composition (e.g., see @nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017), leaf traits, and photosynthesis . Linked to this local biophysical variation is the partitioning of evapotranspiration ($ET$) into soil evaporation, canopy evaporation, and transpiration, which occur across varying spatiotemporal scales depending on light availability, water stress, stomatal physiology, and turbulent transfer (Lawrence et al. 2007, Staudt et al. 2011). Vertical microclimate gradients interact with vertical variation in foliage density, influencing not only the location of evapotranspiration in the canopy, but also differences in rates and net gross primary productivity ($GPP$, Banerjee & Linn 2018). It has been demonstrated that net carbon assimilation and transpiration can vary substantially for forest canopies with the same LAI but different leaf area density distributions (e.g., Katul et al 2004 , Banerjee & Linn 2018). Further, although transpiration tends to be the dominant component of ET, partitioning is more complex in open canopies where soil evaporation can become more dominant (Baldocchi et al. 2004, Ma et al. 2020), likely affecting vertical thermal gradients. In other words, it matters whether foliage is dense or sparse, and whether it is concentrated higher in the canopy, lower in the canopy, or evenly distributed throughout. 


## Implications [ & future research directions?]

*Elsa: If emphsaize future research directions, could move the remote sensing opportunities to this section and frame modeling section around opportunities to use models to further explore open questions, scale these findings in space and time, and influence predictions*
*(In this section, we consider implications of the patterns reviewed above for our understanding of the future of forests--both how we model them and what sorts of responses we can expect under climate change.)*

Still, partitioning $ET$ into its constituent components, let alone vertically partitioning transpiration rates in the canopy, remains a challenge. Eddy covariance techniques, sap flow measurements, and stable isotope analysis offer useful tools, although errors can be large (Williams et al 2004, Herbst et al. 1996). To date, empirical analyses of ET vertical partitioning and interactions with temperature and vegetation structure have be concentrated in midlatitude ecosystems (e.g. Haverd et al 2009, 2011, Staudt et al. 2011, Ringgaard et al. 2014) *(KAT: but see Kunert et al. 2017 -not sure if this is equivalent)*. With respect to changing temperatures, the net effect of leaf- and plant-level thermal responses remains an active area of research, including both how vertical variation in thermal sensitivity influences forest ecosystem dynamics and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. 

Having established how physical conditions and biological form and function vary across vertical gradients, we now turn attention to the implications of these patterns for our understanding of how forest ecosystems may be impacted by global change, and our ability to project this across space and time.


## Global change responses

The complex interwoven relations between the biophysical environment and biological factors--leaf traits, metabolic processes and distribution of trees-- are likely to produce amplifications and feedback loops in a warming world, with implications for forests on many levels.  

### canopy disturbance

Canopies are crucial to microclimatic functioning, as they buffer several aspects of forest microenvironments [Zelleweger et al. 2019]. This buffering is influenced by the hydraulogical-cycle at large [Davis et al. 2019], therefore severe droughts place canopies at risk, particularly as larger trees suffer more during droughts[Bennett et al. 2015]. Further, increasing global temperatures show that canopies of temperate and tropical forests are already functioning close to thermal threshold and beyond photosynthetic optimas [@mau_temperate_2018; @huangAirTemperatureOptima2019]. This can have implications in the tropics, where thermal limits are narrower than in temperate forests [Perez and Feeley, 2018]. Such increase in canopy $T_{leaf}$ has also shown to reduce forest GPP in the tropics [@pauTropicalForestTemperature2018]. 

Canopy structure affects understory species composition and soil fertility, which has been shown to shift under macroclimatic warming and canopy disturbance [@majasalmiImpactTreeCanopy2020; @bertrandCommentForestMicroclimate2020; @maesPlantFunctionalTrait2020]. Macroclimatic warming will disproportionately affect the less warm-adapted functional types within the forest canopy, even with buffering of climatic extremes, thereby creating holes in the canopy that will take a long time to refill (especially in slow-growing tropical sub-canopy specialists), with associated understory plant thermophilization (death is faster than recruitment and growth) [@duqueThermophilizationAdultJuvenile2015a; @zellweger_forest_2020; @zellweger_seasonal_2019; @defrenneMicroclimateModeratesPlant2013]. This imposes an increasing threat to the biodiversity in microrefugias that are  otherwise buffered from extremes [@scheffersMicrohabitatsReduceAnimal2013].

### warming

Warming shifts forest composition, from leaf metabolism to whole forest structure. At a leaf metabolism level, fluxnet global analysis shows that with temperature increase, foliage photosynthesis and respiration are coupled at different rates upto photosynthetic thermal optimum, beyond this inflection point, photosynthesis declines whereas respiration increases exponentially, therfore, moving from carbon sink to carbon source, independent of water and irradiance [@duffyHowCloseAre2021]. However, taken into account light-induced lower leaf respiration in the day, partionationing of C losses differ diurnally and seasonally across ecosytems [@keenanWidespreadInhibitionDaytime2019]. However, nitrogen that is particularly essential for plant metabolic processes has also shown to decline in forests with warming [Templer et al.]. Temperature driven photosynthesis limitation is also reducing tree growth rates, accompanying a global trend towards more frequently disturbed forests dominated by younger trees [@mcdowellPervasiveShiftsForest2020]. Further, combination of warm-season associated with increased VPD, along with drought exacerbates tree stress[@parkwilliamsTemperaturePotentDriver2013] leading to mortality [@gouldenCaliforniaForestDieoff2019], with implications for forest structure. [**to include Teskey 2015; Breashers et al. 2021**]

Feedback loops from loss of big trees through natural or anthropogenic disturbance (e.g.@senfCanopyMortalityHas2018a, 2020;  @mcdowellMechanismsPlantSurvival2008; @bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015; @stovallTreeHeightExplains2019a] would increase canopy roughness, and reductions in canopy cover is associated with reduced canopy structural complexity [@senfMappingForestDisturbance2020]. Leading to altered biophysical gradient with local heating effects [@zellweger_forest_2020; @starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020], non-linear threshold responses, causing dramatic shifts from one forest state to another (e.g., transition from forest to savanna-like vegetation in tropical forest regions through "savannization"), with energy balance impacts and implications for forest-atmosphere interactions [@starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020]. 

In the face of global climate change, resiliency among forests also stand out, such as African rainforests, with canopy trees that are more resilient to warming and drought than other forests [@bennettResistanceAfricanTropical2021]. Increasing temperature acclimation among tropical, temperate and boreal species [@slotGeneralPatternsAcclimation2015; @slotPhotosyntheticPlasticityTropical2021; @wayJustRightTemperature2019; @cunninghamTemperateRainforestTrees2003; @cunninghamTemperateRainforestTrees2003] and recovery from canopy heat stress [@smithEmpiricalEvidenceResilience2020] are other mechanisms that will help forests cope with warming.

These shifts in forest structure at large may be detectable by lidar and thermal remote sensing. If we know how metabolism maps to the thermal profile, then the observed forest structural changes can inform prediction of forest function.
 
## Scaling across space and time 

*Scaling our understanding across space and time requires remote sensing and models.*

### Remote sensing 

An increasing availability of airborne and spaceborne LiDAR remote sensing data offers a promising opportunity for mapping vertical thermal gradients and vegetation structure. [Drone based FLIR cams, tower thermal cams (Pau et al 2018), ECOSTRESS]. To evaluate large-scale ecosystem patterns, high resolution vertically resolved vegetation structure from LiDAR data can be analyzed in combination with collocated field measurements collected using towers (FluxNet REF), canopy cranes (@nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017), or by tree climbing (REF – e.g. Asner papers, Shenkin et al – Unding Jami’s work). Existing research efforts have already revealed incredibly heterogeneity in vegetation structure, diversity, traits, and properties both within and across ecosystems (REFS – Stovall, Schneider, …others).

### Representing Vertical Gradients in Models

Models are needed to predict future ecosystem dynamics, which remain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in Earth System Model (ESM) projections of the future of global carbon cycling and climate change (*Friedlingstein et al. 2006*). 
Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) comprise the land surface models in ESMs used to predict the global distribution of vegetation types and biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks (Cao & Woodward, 1998; Foley et al., 1996; Sitch et al., 2003; Woodward & Lomas, 2004). 
DGVMs operate at a range of scales and have varying degrees of complexity, ranging from detailed individual-based models (*a.k.a.* forest gap models), which represent vegetation at the level of individual plants, capturing spatial variability in the light environment and microclimates at high vertical and horizontal resolution (Christoffersen et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2016; Fyllas et al., 2014; Sato et al. 2007; Shuman et al. 2014; Smith et al., 2001; Bugmann, 2001; Dietze & Latimer, 2011), to big-leaf models that reduce 3D vegetation structure across the entire biosphere into a single vegetation layer (Fig. `r fig_model`). 
This simplification results in greater computational efficiency and thus easier integration into ESMs (Arora & Boer, 2010; Bonan et al. 2003; Cox, 2001; Krinner et al., 2005), although it comes at a cost of a lack of representation of important demographic processes, canopy gap formation, vertical light competition, competitive exclusion, and successional recovery from disturbance (Feeley et al., 2007; Hurtt et al. 1998; Moorcroft et al., 2001; Smith et al. 2001; Stark et al., 2012). 
Improved representation of vegetation demographic processes in ESMs, specifically including forest canopy architectural variation in both horizontal and vertical directions, has repeatedly been identified as a critical step toward reduced uncertainty  and more accurate characterization of biologically mediated feedbacks (Banerjee & Linn 2018, Evans, 2012; Moorcroft, 2006; Moorcroft, Hurtt, & Pacala, 2001; Purves & Pacala, 2008; Thomas, Brookshire, & Gerber, 2015).
Still, as models increase in complexity, model developments and improvements have direct tradeoffs with increased computational cost and potentially decreased interpretability of model output, highlighting the need to identify and parsimoniously represent the most essential drivers of forest ecosystem function. 

-Shading by the overstory can be better represented to predict understory temperatures by modeling the time-varying interaction of the forest canopy with solar radiation, as has been done in other LIDAR-based analyses (e.g., Bode et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.01.028, Musselman et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.05.021, Davis et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.02.015)

![**Figure `r fig_model`. DRAFT. Enrich this by showing 3-4 carefully selected scenarios (e.g., baseline, warming-mesic, warming-drought, canopy disturbance), and maybe a few key processes/ consequences (leaf T, C balance).** [Issue #42](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/42). ](schematics/model_schematic.png)

**The findings of this review reinforce the notion that representing vertical structuring is essential to capturing forest dynamics under global change.**
*[how?]*

**The computationally feasible approach to representing vertical structuring in DVGMs lies in Cohort-based models (CBMs), which sit in the middle of this continuum between the oversimplified vegetation dynamics in big-leaf models and the computational expense of individual-based models.** CBMs represent vegetation as cohorts of individual plants, grouped together based on properties including size, age, and functional type (Haverd et al., 2013; Hurtt et al., 1998; Lischke et al. 2006; Medvigy et al. 2009; Moorcroft et al., 2001; Scherstjanoi et al. 2014; Smith et al., 2014; Weng et al., 2015). 
*(KAT: I think all of the following content is great, but probably needs to be heavily tightened:)*

To review the vertical light environment and thermodynamics of CBMs in more detail, we focus here on the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), a model that is actively undergoing continued development and application across a range of ecosystems and landscapes (Moorcroft et al. 2001, Longo et al 2019 Pt 1 & pt 2). ED2 is also the progenitor of the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), the DGVM coupled with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) (Xu & Christoffersen 2017 ) . In ED2, cohorts are tracked across multiple size-classes or individuals within the same plant functional type (PFT). Each cohort can encounter multiple light environments within a single climatic grid cell depending on patch-level disturbance history and vertical light competition that modulates interactions between plant traits and resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the light environment and canopy structure across patches within a grid cell gives rise to varying horizontal and vertical micro-environments that differ in temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil nutrient conditions (Fisher et al 2018). The energy, water, and carbon dioxide cycles are solved separately for each patch in ED2, while fluxes and storage associated with individual plants are solved for each cohort within patches (Longo et al 2019). As a result, vegetation structure and functional distributions are emergent properties in the model that depend on plant functional traits and their interactions with abiotic environmental conditions. Each plant perceives a unique environment, including incident light, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit that varies across local scales in association with the horizontal and vertical position of each cohort relative to other cohorts, in addition to patch level differences in topographic and edaphic conditions. Coexistence of different vegetation types emerges from different environmental niches, either along a successional gradient of light availability or vertical position in the canopy (Moorcroft et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2001; Purves & Pacala, 2008).

Temperature is an atmospheric boundary condition driving the ED2 model (Longo et al 2019). Each patch in each grid cell is defined by a thermodynamic envelope, comprised of distinct thermodynamic systems for each soil layer, temporary surface water or snow layer, the aboveground component of each cohort, and the canopy air space (Longo et al 2019). The  atmosphere above and outside of the canopy air space is referred to as free air and is determined directly from boundary conditions in ED2. Patches exchange heat and mass with the free air  and lose water and associated energy through surface and sub-surface runoff. The net enthalpy flux of soil, temporary surface water, and vegetation thermodynamic systems in ED2 are exclusively due to associated water fluxes, whereas the eddy flux between the free air and the canopy air space includes both water transport and flux associated with the mixing of air with different temperatures between the canopy air space and free air (Longo et al 2019).

Because most CBMs are spatially implicit within grid cells, direct and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is distributed to cohorts of differing heights using radiative transfer models that depend on designated rules associated with how crown architecture is represented, rather than via direct spatial competition determined by spatially explicit crown locations (Fisher et al. 2010?). The flat-top crown method used in ED and ED2 stacks cohort-layers vertically, and a radiative transfer model is used to determine radiation absorbed by each layer at its midpoint, meaning that each cohort is shaded by all taller cohorts. This is distinct from other models that represent crown architecture using a perfect plasticity approximation (PPA) approach, which assumes that tree crowns completely fill canopy gaps through phototropism (stem leaning) and crown filling (Strigul et al. 2008). Discrete canopy layers are comprised of self-organizing crowns that all receive the same incoming radiation. Once the canopy layer is filled with tree crowns, successive shorter trees inhabit the subsequent understory layer and are shaded by the trees in the canopy (Fisher et al 2010/2018?). Models using the PPA approach differ in number of understory layers (e.g. some only have one) (Fisher et al 2018). Though an improvement over big-leaf models, models that separate the canopy into only two layers (e.g., sunlit and shaded portions) may not be able to capture important within-canopy variation in terms of leaf dynamics (e.g., seasonal shifts in vertical leaf area distributions, Smith et al. 2019) and functions (e.g. thermal responses, as we present in this paper). Hence, multi-layered ecosystem models may be necessary for accurately projecting future forest function. (E.g. see de Pury & Farquhar, 1997).


## Conclusions


- across vertical gradients, directional trends in biophysical environment and leaf traits are the rule, suggesting that the physiology and ecology that have these as their underpinnings should also vary
- a number of studies confirm that this is the case.
- However, when we ask the critical question of how the temperature sensitivities  of metabolism and woody growth varies across these different environments, we can't say much-- there are only a small number of studies, often showing insignificant differences or mixed results.
- We lean towards the conclusion that while large canopy trees ware the most vulnerable to warming when combined with drought, understory trees may be more vulnerable under more mesic conditions, but more research is needed. 
- Critically, change to the vertical gradient--e.g., through increased mortality of canopy trees--will change processses across forest strata, with potentially dramatic consequences. (some of the literature on forest degredation or fragmentation could inform what happens when those gradients change)
