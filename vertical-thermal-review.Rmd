## Summary

*(currently too long for NewPhyt)*

Rising temperatures are expected to have profound effects on forests; however, it is not well understood how responses will vary across forest strata.
Here, we synthesize evidence as to how environmental conditions and foliar traits vary across vertical gradients, shaping leaf temperatures, metabolism, and ultimately whole-tree growth and mortality.
Strong vertical microclimatic gradients imply that canopy leaves are exposed to more solar radiation and higher evaporative demand than understory leaves, particularly in forests with dense canopies.
However, foliar traits relevant to shaping leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$) and metabolism also vary strongly across height or light gradients.
Resulting $T_{leaf}$'s exceed air temperature ($T_{air}$) under conditions of high solar radiation, low wind, and low stomatal conductance.
Differences are most pronounced when hydraulic limitations impede evaporative cooling such that $T_{leaf}$'s of sun-exposed canopy leaves become dramatically elevated above both $T_{air}$ and understory $T_{leaf}$.
While leaf metabolism generally increases with height across the vertical gradient, differences in thermal sensitivity, optimal temperatures, and thermal damage thresholds are modest.
The implications for tree performance are mixed: whereas thermal buffering may contribute to the disproportionate stress of larger trees during drought, emerging tree-ring evidence suggests that understory trees experience relatively greater stress from high $T_{air}$.
Additional research will be important for improving our spotty understanding of the thermal sensitivity of metabolism and tree growth across vertical forest gradients.
In the meantime, our findings imply that while large canopy trees are the most vulnerable to warming when combined with drought, understory trees may be more vulnerable under more mesic conditions.

## Introduction

Globally, temperatures have risen # $^\circ$C since YEAR and are expected to rise an additional #-#$^\circ$C by YEAR (IPCC REF). 
There is also increasing severity and frequency of heat waves that may potentially reduce [forest] biomass acculumation and disrupt photosynthesis and metabolic processes across plant species [O'Sullivan;REF ;@perkinsIncreasingFrequencyIntensity2012].
These changes are expected to have profound effects on forest biodiversity and ecosystem function (REFS), and the resulting feedbacks to the climate system (e.g., decreased C storage, altered albedo and hydrology) will have a critical influence on the future of trajectory of climate change [@bonan_ecological_2016, Bonan 2008].
 
**Rising temperatures are likely to have differential impacts on trees of different size and canopy position, in large part because small understory trees exist in a microenvironment that is substantially buffered by the more exposed canopy trees [@zellweger_seasonal_2019; @davis_microclimatic_2019].**

Forests are vertically and horizontally stratified, with trees of different sizes through various successional stages. Overstory trees form canopies that play a crucial role in moderating macro-microclimate [@ozanneBiodiversityMeetsAtmosphere2003; @nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017] by buffering extreme temperatures along with other macroclimatic conditions in the understory. This creates a vertical stratification of biophysical environments such as temperature, light, wind, humidity and Co2 which influences leaf temperature and metabolism along the gradient.[Bertrand et al. 2011]

The capacity of buffering largely depends on canopy cover and water availability [@davis_microclimatic_2019] each of which is subjected to change through climate-driven disturbances such as drought, deforestation, fire and related disruptions.
Increasing temperature has profound impacts on canopy cover such that temperate and tropical forest canopies are already or will soon be functioning beyond their optimal photosynthetic threshold [@mau_temperate_2018; @huangAirTemperatureOptima2019]. Additionally, increased temperature is driving more frequent droughts causing hydraulic limitation in forests [ref]. Water limitation in forests alters species thermoregulation [@sastry_leaf_2018], also decreases tree canopy circumference [@aussenacInteractionsForestStands2000a] due to increased sensitivity of overstory to variability in water and precipitation [@rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory 2020]. Evidence shows that larger trees suffer during drought [resulting in heat stressed canopy-leaves], which may contribute to increasing larger tree mortality in forests around the world should frequencies of drought continue to occur [@@mcdowellMechanismsPlantSurvival2008; @allenUnderestimationGlobalVulnerability2015, Brienen et al. 2015; @bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015; @stovallTreeHeightExplains2019a]. Increases in loss of canopy cover [@senfCanopyMortalityHas2018a; @senfMappingForestDisturbance2020] are also associated with reduced canopy structural complexity, altering microclimates with local heating effects and surface energy balance components [@zellweger_forest_2020; @starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020]. However, in mesic forest conditions, availability of water enables canopies with suitable foliar traits to remain cool through continues evapotranspiration and consequential buffering of the understory [REF]  

While forest microclimates are insulated from the extremes of macroclimate warming, they are still experiencing warming [@bertrandCommentForestMicroclimate2020]. As a result, understories experience a different set of microclimatic pressures with rising temperature in combination with conditions of limited light and related foliar traits, inter-species resource competition etc.. [@bartholomewSmallTropicalForest2020]. Since temperature sensitivity is directly linked with plant metabolic processes and growth, even around 1 degree of warming can lead to changes in plant species composition and growth [Bertrand et al.2011]. Tree-ring evidence shows reduced growth of understory trees relative to overstory with warming temperatures, in mesic temperate forests[@rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory, 2020], along with other studies that show thermophilization in plant communities and reshuffling of species acclimated to cooler [mean annual] temperatures[@duqueThermophilizationAdultJuvenile2015; @zellweger_forest_2020; @zellweger_seasonal_2019; @defrenneMicroclimateModeratesPlant2013; @suggittExtinctionRiskClimate2018; @scheffersMicrohabitatsReduceAnimal2013]. Considering more frequent occurences of drought, extensive analysis also shows negetive correlation between species shade tolerance and drought tolerance globally [@niinemetsControversyTraitsConferring2006] which may have further impacts on understory species with rising temperatures. 
Microclimate warming has implications for forest regeneration[@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a] as temperature driven photosynthesis limitation is leading to reduced tree growth rates, driving a global trend towards disequillibrium in forests with younger trees [@mcdowellPervasiveShiftsForest2020].
Reductions in canopy cover can lead to non-linear threshold responses, causing dramatic shifts from one forest state to another (e.g., transition from forest to savanna-like vegetation in tropical forest regions through "savannization"), with energy balance impacts and implications for forest-atmosphere interactions [@starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020]. Each of these changes have potential feedbacks to climate change.

While there is evidence for temperature driven shifts in forest dynamics, leaf-level temperature and metabolism changes influenced by biophysical conditions and warming in overstory and understory is still unclear. Thus, it is becoming more important than ever to understand foliage thermal sensitivity in forests along the vertical canopy profile, from the understory to the top of the canopy influenced by biophysical environmental gradient.This will provide crucial insights for how rising temperature affects forest ecology and biodiversity, energy balance, ecosystem function, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions [with additional feedbacks to forest structure and microclimates].


(@niinemetsWithincanopyVariationRate2004a highlights how biophysical and photosynthetic gradient varies along the vertical canopy profile, however our current knowledge of this topic is lacking.)

**We lack a systematic, up to date understanding of biophysical and biological patterns across this gradient, how these affect leaf-level processes, and in turn how it affects ecosystems (Fig. ` r fig_schematic`).** 

**This review addresses the following questions:**

i.	How does the biophysical environment vary with height in forests? ("What aspects of biophysical envt? Microclimate and vertical plant structure/phenology/etc (ok yes, see this in fig ` r fig_schematic`)"?--Elsa:
So change to micrometeorological environment? Not biological just physical in this question, right?

ii.	How do leaf traits vary with height (or between sun and shade leaves) in forests?(What types of leaf traits?-E.O)

iii. How do vertical changes in biophysical environment conditions and leaf traits combine to affect leaf temperature [and in turn photosynthetic capacity]??

iv.	How does leaf metabolism respond to temperature in canopy and understory settings?

v. What are the implications of these patterns for the ecology ecosystem and climate change responses of canopy versus understory trees?

vi.	What are the implications for modeling/ scaling / What are the implications of these leaf-scale responses at the ecosystem scale [in the context of climate change] / How do these leaf-level responses scale to entire ecosystems(*nerge these better*)

*Our primary interest is the gradient in height and exposure from the top of the canopy to the understory in forests. However, because a lot of the relevant research has focused on exposure gradients near ground level (e.g., comparisons of sun and shade leaves), and the implications [or utility] for ecosystem models we also review studies focused on exposure gradients.*

![**Figure 1. (schematic of a forest summarizing most important gradients--sort of a "graphical abstract".** Current version is just a very rough sketch of how this might look – needs to be filled in with content from the review. We could have a set of arrows for each of the major categories considered here. This would be a key figure, and should be beautifully illustrated—KAT could do a watercolor, or Nidhi could illustrate- and make use of NewPhyt's figure editing service for Tansley reviews). ](schematic/schematic.png)


Martijn : in this illustration it would also be nice to show that you can have shade leaves of canopy trees in the understory, and shaded plants of understory species.

## The biophysical environment

The biophysical environment, here defined to include the physical structure of the forest canopy (from understory to the canopy top) and associated microclimates, is in large part determined by the structure of the forest itself. 
We supplement review of the existing literature with a new analysis of data on vegetation structure and vertical profiles in microclimate from the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON; Appendix `r appendix_NEON_methods`; Schimel et al. 2007].

Canopy foliage, which varies across forest types and seasonally, strongly shapes the understory light, wind, etc.
Forest canopies have a buffering effect on multiple aspects of the understory climate (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).


- (*@bonan_ecological_2016 reviews this and points to appropriate references*)

*(paragraph on leaf area distribution, including figure ([separate from or combined with current Fig. 2- see GitHub issue #15](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/15))*
The vertical structure and hence, microenvironments of forest canopies vary seasonally (Parker & Tibbs 2004; Smith et al. 2019 ; Parker et al. 2019) and following disturbance (e.g., Parker et al. 2002 ; Almeida et al. 2016 ; Stark et al. 2020 in press).
In this review, we focus primarily on growing season conditions, including leaf phenology at the edges of the growing season but excluding periods (in deciduous forests) when no leaves are present.


Light conditions, specifically photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) varies along the vertical gradient with leaf area index (LAI), canopy height, canopy structure, across species and forest types due to cumulative layers of vegetation [@koike_leaf_2001]. Generally, upper canopies in dense forests are exposed to greater PAR values and limit light to canopy interiors, lower canopy layers and understories. Shaded regions under canopy cover experience lower values and quality of PAR [in ranges of blue, orange and red]. The gradient of light is more pronounced under broadleaved forests than conifers[@aussenacInteractionsForestStands2000a; @niinemetsPackingPhotosyntheticMachinery2009; Parker 1995; @poorterMetaanalysisPlantResponses2019b]
(Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).
In heterogeneous canopies [with high gap fractions], distance from the outer canopy is a better proxy for light environment than height (Parker 1995) and lower canopy light environments are highly variable, ranging from high light gap to deeply shaded understory regions [@chazdonPhotosyntheticLightEnvironments1984; @tymenQuantifyingMicroenvironmentalVariation2017; @smithSeasonalDroughtrelatedChanges2019]. 
 Tropical forests with dense overstory limit light to understories and subsequent layers, where tropical forest floors receive approximately 1-2%  of the light incident to the top of the canopy [@robertsStomatalBoundaryLayerConductances1990a; @chazdonPhotosyntheticLightEnvironments1984; @parkerConsequencesEnvironmentalHeterogeneity2019], whereas mixed-wood boreal and Northern temperate forest floors receive around 4-5% of full sunlight [@bartemucciOverstoryInfluencesLight2006].
This difference in light regime along a vertical profile is an important driver of plasticity in leaf traits, leaf physiology, adaptation, and thermal sensitivity along the gradient. Leaves along a vertical intra-canopy gradient thus exhibit a variation in leaf trait adapaptions to a range of high light to shaded-ness [@michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016; @fauset_differences_2018; @niinemetsResponsesForestTrees2010, @sackHowStrongIntracanopy2006; @doughtyAreTropicalForests2008; Niinemets and Valladares 2006].

-	Sunflecks: Leaky et al. 2003--from Marielle, "This is another, higher resolution axis of the variability of microenvironments that is probably quite important to address. (Also see the papers by Robin Chazdon on temporal variability of light environments). Maybe we will want to add these sentences (above) and something about sunflecks to a separate section that specifically addresses sources of variation in forest structure & microenvironments (e.g., vertical, horizontal, seasonal, diurnal, and with disturbance)?"

**Wind speeds are also higher at the top of the canopy (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).**
*(fill in some specifics from the NEON analysis)*
Consistent with the results from NEON sites, higher wind speed at greater heights within a forest have previously been observed in both closed canopy forests [@barnardSeasonalVariationCanopy2016a; @mcgregor_tree_nodate] and open savannas [@curtis_intracanopy_2019] in summer months.

Wind speed in the upper canopy of a semi-deciduous tropical forest has been observed to be higher in dry season of than in upper canopy wet season [@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016].[*double check*] 
Greater upper canopy wind speeds result in higher boundary layer conductance ($g_{a}$) for canopy leaves, which increases linearly with increase in wind velocity [@daudetWindSpeedLeaf1999a]. Large $g_{a}$ to heat transfer results in smaller difference in $T_{air}$ and $T_{leaf}$, this is more typical of small leaves in upper canopy that make them more advantageous in dissapating heat efficiently than larger leaves[@bauerleSeparatingFoliarPhysiology2011]. In low wind conditions, because $g_{a}$ to heat transfer is small enough, $T_{leaf}$ in upper canopy can become substantially elevated than $T_{air}$ under high radiation [@martin_boundary_1999]. Additionally, thickness of air layer is proportional to boundary layer resistance at the surface of the leaf through which water vapor diffuses after leaving the stomata [@martin_boundary_1999; @robertsStomatalBoundaryLayerConductances1990a; @stokesBoundaryLayerConductance2006]. 

**Air temperature, $T_{air}$, is sometimes significantly buffered by forest canopies (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).**
Studies comparing $T_{air}$ under forest canopies with nearby clearings have found lower maximum temperatures under forest canopies globally [@defrenneGlobalBufferingTemperatures2019], and recent evidence shows of a similar trend across Europe [@zellweger_seasonal_2019; @vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a] and in the northwestern United States [@davis_microclimatic_2019]. Even though canopy cover buffers maximum air temperatures in the understory, inevitable increase in understory temperatures continue to be observed as a result of global increase in temperatures, however the buffering by canopy cover smoothens this warming in the understory [@bertrandCommentForestMicroclimate2020; @zellwegerResponseCommentForest2020;@rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory]

Diurnal moderating capacity differs between forests with varying canopy structure, crown density, and seasons. Tropical, and temperate broadleaved and non-pine conifer forests maintain lower daytime maximum temperatures than pine and boreal forests. Increase in crown density and leaf area index decreases light and higher maximum temperature permeability into forest understory, thus maintaining greater lower maximum daytime temperature. Comparitively open forests such as pine forests have sparse stands resulting in decreased buffering capacity in understory and closer air temperatures to nearby clearings [@@defrenneGlobalBufferingTemperatures2019; @vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a]. This relationship is reveresed during the night, however, with pine forests maintaining warmer below canopy temperature than above[@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a] 

Similarly, maximum air temperatures were higher above than below tropical forest canopies during wet seasons in Panama [@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016], temperate forests in Switzerland [@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a] and coastal Brazil [@fauset_differences_2018, Tymen et al. 2017].

"max temps were higher and humidity lower in gaps vs understory regions (both at 1.5 m above the ground), see Fig. 4 - again illustrating buffering effect of the canopy".However, similar maximum temperatures have been observed during the dry season of a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama partially because in the dry season some canopy trees were leafless, resulting in more light reaching the sub-canopy, and more air movement between subcanopy and above-canopy air[@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016], similar results were observed in in a temperate deciduous forest in the eastern United States [@mcgregor_tree_nodate].

Minimum $T_{air}$ is also buffered by forest canopies under some conditions.
Higher minimum temperatures under forest canopies relative to nearby clearings have been observed across Europe [@zellweger_seasonal_2019] and in the northwestern United States [@davis_microclimatic_2019].(Martijn: should we refer to mechanisms at this point? (e.g., greater radiative heat loss in exposed areas resulting in lower Tmin))
However, similar minimum temperatures under forest canopies have been observed in tropical forests in Panama [@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016] and coastal Brazil [@fauset_differences_2018], as well as in a temperate deciduous forest in the eastern United States [@mcgregor_tree_nodate; @nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017].


*(Add something about risk of freeze.)* 


**Humidity also varies across the forest vertical profile, being generally higher in the understory (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).**
- DETAILS - REFS
- @mcgregor_tree_nodate

Along with temperature, forest canopies moderate relative humidity in below-canopy microclimates. In three European forest types (Broadleaved, Non-Pine Conifer, Pine) canopy buffering decreased daily maximum $T_{air}$ and increased daily minimum RH in below-canopy microclimate compared to a nearby open area. Moderating capacity was stronger under broadleaved and non-pine conifer forests than pine, and greater in wetter conditions, and in summer and autumn months than winter [@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a]. 

With rising temperatures, this trend in maximum $T_{air}$ and RH would have implications for understory seedling growth, especially in high altitude temperate pine forests and montane forests  [@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a; @fauset_differences_2018] (to clarify why? are these high elevation forests limited by low temperature and low rh?)  

RH, in combination with temperature, determines vapor pressure deficit, $VPD$. Atlantic forests during wet season tended to have higher $T_{air}$, and $VPD$ in upper canopy and canopy gaps than lower in understory where $T_{air}$ and $VPD$ were lower [@fauset_differences_2018; @tymenQuantifyingMicroenvironmentalVariation2017].  
This means that canopy leaves tend to be exposed to higher *evaporative demand*, higher stomtal contrains and lower osmotic potential. [@niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004a]. In North Eastern US temperate forests, upper canopy was observed to be more sensitive to $VPD$, whereas as understory was insensitive [[@rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory, 2020]

**Finally, carbon dioxide (CO~2~) concentrations tend to be higher in the understory.** 
-	Higher in understory, particularly at dusk (Koike et al. 2001).
-	Higher in the understory overnight; difference persists during the day but is very small [@yang_spatial_1999].
- Differences in concentration are by far most pronounced near ground level, as well, concentrations of (CO~2~) mole fraction values have been observed to be higher in lower canopy leaves compared with upper canopy leaves [@niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004a]

Given that differences are small during the day when photosynthesis is active, and that even nighttime differences are modest at the height of understory tree crowns, CO~2~ concentration is unlikely to have much effect on the energy balance and metabolism of leaves across the forest vertical gradient.

If soil and stem respiration do not acclimate fully to rising temperatures, the greater amount of CO2 emitted at the forest floor could increase the vertical CO2 gradient in the future, but this would still only be a short-term effect in the early morning, as the CO2 would quickly diffuse through the canopy. Furthermore, increases in mortality of big trees (e.g. Senf et al. 2018) would increase canopy roughness and prevent build-up of CO2 concentration gradients.

**The strength of this buffering varies across forests, being influenced by both forest characteristics (Fig. `r fig_NEON_differences`) and the biophysical environment.**
First, buffering increases with canopy cover and water availabity.
* greater cover --> lower max T and VPD, higher minT  [@davis_microclimatic_2019]
* greater cover -->  lower max T and light availability [@zellweger_seasonal_2019]
* [@thom_effects_2020; Tymen et al. 2017 ; Jucker et al. 2018 ; Hardwick et al. 2015] 
The omega factor (McNaughton and Jarvis, 1983; Jarvis & McNaughton 1986) describes the degree of aerodynamic coupling between the vegetation and the atmospheric boundary layer; the lower the value of omega, the greater the coupling.
"I wonder whether it would be useful to introduce such 'formal' terms used to describe what is essentially the same as buffering effect of canopies.
I'd have to read up some more to see if there are papers showing what sort of canopy characteristics influence omega.

https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2504(08)60119-1"-M.Slot

*Presumably, buffering would also be affected by canopy roughness, which affects turbulent air flow and the canopy boundary layer.*
Taller trees don't necessarily increase buffering [@zellweger_seasonal_2019]. 
Species that have higher shade casting ability such as braodleaved trees increase T buffering [@zellweger_seasonal_2019,@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012]
The strength of buffering also varies with respect to geographic and climatic factors.
* Distance to coast, topographic position, elevation [@zellweger_seasonal_2019]
* [@davis_microclimatic_2019]--Proximity to riparian areas tends to sustain buffering, protecting understory temperatures even during increasing temperatures [@davis_microclimatic_2019]
However vertical climate gradients within forests are known to be steeper than those driven by elevation and latitude [@nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017; @martinCovarianceSunShade2020a]

## Trait variation 

Leaf traits are shaped by intra canopy light and height, and show intra-canopy plasticity in accordance with intensity and availability of light. Taller trees in dense forests tend to be exposed to greater irradiance than lower canopy and shorter understory trees shaded by overstory.Degrees of high irradiance has consequential adaptations in leaf morphology compared to degrees of low irradiance to shaded-ness [@poorterMetaanalysisPlantResponses2019b; Sack et al 2006] within- and across species [Ishii et al. 2018; @niinemetsWorldwideAnalysisWithincanopy2015]. This dichotomy in leaf traits that vary with light intensity generally differ within intra-canopy, however the degree of intra-canopy plasticity also varies across species and geographically [@sackHowStrongIntracanopy2006; @ishiiVariationIntracrownLeaf2018].

Adaptions of traits to ranges of sun-exposure or shaded-ness also vary within a forest strata. 
Understory species may have conservative  growth strategies because they are resource (light) limited. Spending their lifecycle in the shade means they have different pressures than plants that get the bulk of their carbon from sun-exposed leaves, but can maintain a few layers of shade leaves as well. Their traits will be different from shade leaves of canopy trees as well. E.g.
They tend to have long-lived leaves with high LMA while shade leaves of canopy trees have large leaves with low LMA. Those differences in traits are likely to affect their thermal properties as well.
Additionally, shade leaves in the understory are of three categories; 1. shade leaves of canopy trees--top of the tree is sun exposed, bottom is shaded. 2. seedlings/saplings of canopy trees that will eventually, if they survive, reach the canopy. 3 understory plants that complete their lifecycle in the shaded understory. These groups are likely to have different traits, and if we expect 'shade' plants to have a different sensitivity to climate change than sun leaves, the consequences of climate change for demography and species community composition of the forest will depend strongly on the category of shade plants being considered.[refs]

Cateogorization of sun and shade tolerance from @niinemetsControversyTraitsConferring2006: "The five-level scale used for shade tolerance (1,
very intolerant; 2, intolerant; 3, moderately tolerant; 4,tolerant; 5, very tolerant) corresponds approximately to the following light availabilities expressed as percentage of full sunlight: 1,>50%; 2, 25-50%; 3, 10-25%; 4, 5-10%; 5, 2-5%"

Passing light in the forest understory often caused by over-canopy vegetation and wind speed called sunflecks cause a different type of morphological adaptation in shaded leaves [characterized by low LMA and greater effective leaf width] that make them efficient in capturing >50% of light through sunflecks for photosynthesis [@chazdonPhotosyntheticLightEnvironments1984]

[I think that this distinction should be addressed throughout the manuscript, so that it is always clear that the reader knows whether the cited references are about inter- or intra-specific variation, and that we address the different trait axes (Marielle made a comment on this earlier as well, that within species patterns may not follow leaf economics spectrum expectations). Ideally we would address the different categories, but if lack of information forces us to focus on just within species or just across species, this should still be made clear. photosynthesis, and canopy-level carbon uptake. They don't have to be treated separately, but it should always be clear which is being referred to. And in the consequences for scaling section this is of course also relevant.]

Increasing number of studies point towards the importance of incorporating vertical canopy leaf trait variation in modelling for leaf economic spectrum (LES) [@chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020a], leaf thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity which will provide a more accurate representation of within-canopy gradient response to increasing temperatures.[@fauset_differences_2018; @michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016; @niinemetsWorldwideAnalysisWithincanopy2015, @chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020, REFS)


[Add something about how leaf traits along the vertical canopy profile are different than the expectation from leaf economic spectrum (LES)? Chen et al. 2020 is a good paper to help frame this . They make an important point in that paper that we may also want to make here: that the LES was 'built' using mainly sun (upper canopy) leaves; given the vastly different light environments at the bottom of the canopy (and that most leaves in the canopy are likely to be shade leaves) there is a strong research need to better characterise trait relationships and leaf responses through the whole vertical canopy - hence the importance of this review. Keenan & Niinemets 2016  will also be helpful in making this point.]--M N. Smith

**Many traits vary with height and/or between sun and shade leaves on the same species (Table 1).**
Here, we focus on intra-canopy traits that are important for shaping leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$) and thermal sensitivity.

Are traits shaped more by height or light?
-	 “Height is more important than light in determining leaf morphology in a tropical forest” (Cavaleri et al. 2010)
- 	(Cavaleri et al. 2008) 
- from Martijn: "If I remember correctly, height and light exposure are closely correlated and things like LMA scale with both, but above a certain level of light exposure, the effect of additional light disappears, while the relationship of the morphological traits with height continues. I have often been a bit skeptical about assuming height drives morphology, as most of the work that convincingly shows that (and relates it to turgor pressure for example) is from 100 m tall redwoods."

*Leaf area / characteristic dimension*:
- Recent paper on influence on leaf size/shape in PCE – certain aspects of leaf shape were not as relevant as expected (Leigh et al. 2017? https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pce.12857)
- Max stomatal conductance - increases with canopy height (Kenzo et al. 2015)
Max transpiration rate - increases with canopy height (Kenzo et al. 2015).
Leaf width and characteristic dimension influence boundary layer resistance which generally is greater in wider understory leaves than upper canopy.
Leaf temperature increases with leaf area {Wright et al. 2019}
-Boundary layer resistance and thermal sensitivity also depends of leaf width, leaf size and structure. Increase in leaf width increases stomatal resistance-- dependent on stomtal activity and boundary layer resistance [@fauset_differences_2018]. Leaf characteristics such as lobes, leaf elongation and serration, all facilitate in dissapating heat more efficiently. Leaf lobes are deeper in exposed canopy than in shaded understory, as well as leaf elongation and serration are more pronounced in sun exposed canopies[Vogel 1970; Roth-Nebelsick 2001;
Schuepp 1993; Sack et al. 2006].
-Boundary layer thickness, depth and boundary layer resistance increases with leaf size and effective leaf width [along the vertical gradient], such that the rate of heat convection per unit area between leaf and air is lower for large leaves and greater for small leaves, therefore allowing small leaves to dissapate heat more efficiently than large leaves [@leighInfluenceLeafSize2017].

*Thermal time constant (probably not a lot out there)*
-	Curtis et. al, 2018 – higher in more exposed leaves (heat up slower, cool slower)
-	Michaeletz has used this in theoretical calculations (Michaeletz et al. 2016 and 2015?
I have Michaletz's code to calculate the thermal time constant, so if there are data, or general tendencies for changes in leaf area, LMA, leaf width and leaf dry matter content we can determine how these trends would translate into changes in thermal time constant. 
In practice, an important driver seems to be leaf water content per unit area (I think Lawren might have mentioned this as well in our meeting), so if we can conclude that that is something that scales with the vertical gradient, then we can make an informed guess about how the thermal time constant will change--Martijn Slot
-Effective leaf width defined as the largest circle that can be inscribed in a leaf is an effective predictor of leaf thermal time constant and leaf boundary layer thickness. Large leaves have greater effective leaf width which increases their thermal time constant by prolonging leaf cooling time compared to small leaves that have a smaller effective leaf width, and thus small thermal time constant with shorter cooling time. Increased leaf width typical in larger leaves was also observed to increase leaf to air temperature difference. [@leighInfluenceLeafSize2017]   


*Carotinoids/Xanthophyll cycle pigments* 
-	photoprotective- disseminate heat, acclimate to high T. THese are proportional to irradiance 
-	antioxidant scavenging function- protect against cellular damage
- Koniger et. al. 1995, and  Matsubara et al. 2009

*Isoprene production*
-  Isoprene production *capability* as a trait (actual isoprene production is in section 4. I'm not sure whether Ty's content belongs here or in that section) 

*(Paragraph on intra- vs inter-specific variation)*

- *Are patterns (in traits, metabolism, ecology) driven by tree height or exposure?*

## Leaf temperature and hydraulics

**Many of the biophysical and trait variable reviewed above affect leaf temperature, $T_{leaf}$, which in turn has a strong influence on leaf metabolism (see following section).**
$T_{leaf}$ is determined by the energy balance of a leaf and can be estimated based on basic biophysical principles [@campbell_introduction_1998; @muir_tealeaves_2019] (Fig. 3).
- As light availability typically increases with tree height, leaf temperature which is largely of function of radiation input, does as well [@michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015]. Direct sunlight in upper canopy leaves increases leaf temperature, [sometimes 1-7C above ambient air temperature, making upper canopy leaves susceptible to heat stress] more than scattered light in lower shaded leaves [@mauTemperateTropicalForest2018a]
While small leaves remain within a few degrees of $T_{air}$, regardless of stomatal conductance, wider leaves can have temperatures deviating more from air temperature.[@fauset_differences_2018]
Large leaves can be significantly cooler than $T_{air}$ under low radiation with stomata open, and significantly hotter under high radiation with stomata closed.  
Leaves with open stomata and high radiation loads maintain $T_{leaf}$ similar to $T_{air}$, with coolest leaves at intermediate sizes (~10mm).
Shaded understory leaves should tend to maintain cooler daytime leaf temperatures for any given level of stomatal conductance.
However, counteracting this, lower wind speed in understory would reduce latent heat loss.
Thus, under hot conditions, canopy leaves exposed to higher wind speeds would be most effective at cooling when sufficient water is available to maintain high stomatal conductance; however, their $T_{leaf}$ can be highly elevated above $T_{air}$ when stomatal conductance is limiting.
- increase in air temperature, increases VPD, decrease in stomtal conductance during miday leading to decrease in CO2 in leaf = increase in leaf temperature in upper canopy. [@fauset_differences_2018]

Leaf temperature in response to (a) XXX, (b) XXX (key trait or environmental variables).** Examples to be produced based on energy balance model using the tealeaves R package of @muir_tealeaves_2019: https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/6.

**Aligning with biophysical expectations, field observations have shown that leaf temperatures are influenced by the biophysical environment and leaf traits.**
1.	Air T
2.	Solar radiation
3.	Leaf traits 
-  Michaletz et al have done some interesting work on leaf thermoregulation in relation to various leaf traits. I don’t think there is sun vs shade tests, but we could look at how this might translate, or how some of the traits he has calculated might differ between sun and shade leaves. For example, he has this thermal time constant parameter that is calculated from leaf mass per area, leaf dry matter content, and some environmental parameters. E.g.: DOI: 10.1038/nplants.2016.129, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.09.006

**When vertical gradients in the biophysical environment and leaf traits combine to shape leaf energy budgets, under some conditions $T_{leaf}$ tracks  $T_{air}$ and therefore differs little between understory and canopy (Fig. **2?**).**
In a broadleaf deciduous forest, nighttime $T_{leaf}$'s were similar in the canopy and understory	(Bolstad et al. 1999).
Similarly, during the dry season in a tropical moist forest in Panama... (Rey-Sánchez et al. 2016).
**However, canopy leaves can reach much higher maximum $T_{leaf}$, and higher $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$, than understory leaves.**
-Large leaf to air temperature differences and high leaf temperatures were found in upper canopy of Atlantic, Brazil Forests despite much lower air temperature due to high solar radiation loads. However, leaf temperatures themselves were moderaed by air temperature. [@fauset_differences_2018].
-	(Slot et al. 2019) and refs therein
-	(Fauset et al. 2018)
Sun leaves can also be  cooled relative to $T_{air}$ more than shade leaves (Rey-Sánchez et al. 2016). There's some hint of this in Bolstad et al. 1999.

*(Because hydraulics are key to leaf T, we should include some of that here--e.g., water on leaves and leaf water content)*

## Leaf metabolism and thermal responses

Leaf metabolism is strongly shaped by leaf temperature, and by the traits and environmental drivers reviewed above, all of which vary across vertical forest gradients (Fig. 1). 
However, as we detail below, there are limited studies comparing thermal responses of sun and shade leaves (Table 2).

*Stomatal conductance*
Photosynthesis can be largely constrained by stomatal conductance. 
-"Sun exposed outer canopy leaves in tropical trees can experience temperatures up 48 C during diurnal cycle, midday stomtal closure reduces transpitrational cooling" thus elevating leaf temperature greater than air temperature (Slot et al. 2019)

*Photosynthesis*

**Photosynthesis is generally higher in sun leaves-- a fact that is well-established (Niinemets 2007 ; Kenzo et al. 2015 ; Slot et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020) and observed in numerous field studies.**
This is primarily driven by the greater light available to sun leaves.
In response to the greater light availability, sun leaves have traits allowing greater photosynthetic rates at high light,  including higher concentration of Rubsico, multiple layers of palisade parenchyma, and saturation level differs between leaves and canopies, with leaves saturating at lower light level than canopies (while a certain amount of light saturates the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf, increasing the amount of light in the canopy may increase photosynthesis in the shaded part of the canopy)
The vertical gradient in photosythetic rates is also influenced by available concentration of N and P.
.[thoughts: plasticity vs change in tree species composition through the canopy; differences in variability of microenvironments through the profile - highest lower down in canopy?; life history / investment strategies and hence, leaf life spans at leaves at the top vs bottom of the canopy]-- M N. Smith [agreed. Again the importance of differentiating between within-species and among species trait variation. Also; steepness of the vertical gradient in light and VPD. In very tall trees a gradient in water potential might cause a gradient in stomatal limitations of net photosynthesis]

Photosynthesis increases with increasing irradiance, and saturates at quatum flux density of 400 $m^{-2}$ $s^{-1}$ to 700nm $m^{-2}$ $s^{-1}$. Photosynthesis has a peaked response to temperature, where photosynthesis is commonly found to be maximized at the prevalent ambient growing season conditions (Tan et al. 2017; Slot & Winter 2017).Beyond the optimum photosynthesis decreases as a result of stomatal closure (e.g. Slot & Winter 2017; Smith et al. 2020 [temperate/boreal refs needed) and eventually due to biochemical constraints (refs. e.g. Sage & Kubien 2007; Varhammer et al. 2015 ).Photosynthesis will also be affected by heat stress, when photoinhibition reduces photosynthesis either as a result of photoprotective; non-photochemical quenching or related to irreversible leaf damage leading to leaf necrosis. Leaves in upper canopy tend to experience more heat stress and greater photoinhibition than lower canopy leaves in conditions of water stress or drought. [@niinemetsWorldwideAnalysisWithincanopy2015] 

**While sun and shade leaves differ dramatically in $A_{max}$, the temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis does not appear to differ substantially between sun and shade leaves**
Biophysically, we might expect that sun leaves should tend to have a stronger temperature-dependence and higher temperature optima than shade leaves (Fig. 14.5; *revisit this!*) (Campbell and Norman 1998) as observed by earlier studies, suggesting that the interaction between light gradient and temperature response along vertical canopy profile implied there to be a spectrum of temperature responses of $T_{opt}$,$V_{max}$ and $J_{max}$ along the gradient [@niinemetsWithincanopyVariationRate2004a; Harley and Baldocchi 1995, Friend, 2001].
However, this does not appear to be the case based on the limited number of field studies that have compared temperature sensitivity of photosnythesis in sun and shade leaves.
For 3 species in Panama, @hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020 and @slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019 found that the optimum temperature for sun leaves tended to be slightly higher than that of shade leaves, but differences were not significant. Similiar results were found for $V_{max}$ and $J_{max}$ [@slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019, Hernandez et al.2020]
Mau et al. found no trend in the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis along a height gradient in Puerto Rico, and no significant trend in temperate trees [@mau_temperate_2018].

**Leaf thermal tolerance (Tcrit/ T50)**
- define.
Typical values ~45-50$^\circ$C, varying somewhat 
across latitude/climate (O’sullivan et al. 2017),
with elevation [@feeley_thermal_2020;  Slot unpublished data],
with leaf traits [Sastry et al. 2018, @zhang_photosynthetic_2012].

**Thermal tolerance (e.g., $T_{50}$) varies with exposure, but there are no studies isolating effect of height.**
For two of three species studied in a tropical moist forest in Panama, $T_{50}$ was slightly lower for shade than sun-exposed leaves, both measured near ground level (Slot et al. 2019). 
Similarly, for *Acacia Papyrocarpa* (Benth.) trees in an arid region of southern Australia, higher $T_{50}$ was observed in more exposed (North-facing) canopy positions (Curtis et al. 2019). 
We're not aware of any other studies on this."we may want to argue that we have no a priori reasons to expect thermal tolerance to scale with height per se (or do we?). I think it makes sense to expect variation with light exposure because of the associated differences in temperature you can expect the leaves to be exposed to, but height itself should not affect heat tolerance other than through associated traits perhaps"--Martijn Slot

*Respiration*

**Similar to photosynthesis, respiration tends to be higher in sun leaves (Chen et al. 2020), but its temperature sensitivity appears to be similar between between sun and shade leaves.**
At increasing temperatures, Photosynthetic System 2 [PS2] is particularly vulnerable. Damage to pS2  can lead to decreased electron transport rates and photosynthetic failure. Irreversible damage to PS2 is done at 40-60C [Baker 2008; @feeley_thermal_2020]
(Bolstad et al. 1999) did a study at Coweeta, including elev gradient. 
Found higher respiration (at reference T) in canopy leaves (@bolstad_foliar_1999). (*Martijn has some unpublished data on this that we might include: https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/8.*)
At Coweeta, Q10 showed a variable pattern, with a slight tendency to increase down the canopy [@bolstad_foliar_1999]. (*Martijn has some unpublished data on this that we might include.unpublished data showing higher Q10 in shade than in sun leaves for 10 species or so. May make sense to include here: https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/8.*)
Combining reference respiration and $Q_{10}$, @bolstad_foliar_1999 found  a modest net decrease in R for understory leaves relative to canopy leaves as T increases (*see their Fig. 1*)."Higher $Q_{10}$ values in the functional groups of upper canopy where temperatures are the highest may lead to exponential loses of C with increasing global temperatures depending upon the ability of canopy leaves to acclimate" [@cavaleri_foliar_2008]
Thus, @bolstad_foliar_1999 found evidence of acclimation, but there remained a declining trend of respiration with elevation.


*VOC production*

**Isoprene production**
- high emission rates occur in the mid-canopy, and even from very small statured trees and shrubs, at a site in the Brazilian Amazon (Taylor et al., in prep).
- The high temperature carbon compensation point of sun leaves is higher in isoprene emitting species than in non-emitting species, so it is to be expected that other aspects of heat tolerance will be similarly affected by isoprenes (https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13564).
-  Within species, isporene production scales with light/ T



## Ecosystem Scaling & implications

### Distribution of species and traits across the vertical profile

*(This section should address inter-specific vs intra-specific variation, as Tables 1 and 2 refer to intra-specific variation, but most models will focus on trait variation across strata, regardless of species). 

**Differences across forest vertical gradients in biophysical conditions, plant traits, and metabolism and its thermal responses scale up to affect whole-tree ecology in several ways.** First, vertical gradients in the biophysical environment shape which plant strategies, or sets of traits, are competitive in understory versus canopy conditions. 
-	*Spring and fall leaf phenology in temperate deciduous forests (Augsburger). 	Mechanism: more moderate conditions (T, wind) in understory (REF).*
*Among species that can be deciduous, greater proportion of deciduous individuals in larger size classes (Condit et al. 2000). One potential mechanism is lower temperature/hydraulic stress in understory*
- something on isoprene production?

**Appears to affect community change under warming (Zellweger et al. 2020).**

### Scaling to tree level: demography

**Vertical gradients also affect tree growth and survival, and how these respond to climatic variation.**
There are numerous demographic differences between understory and canopy trees, which have been linked to both the physical environment and plant traits (e.g., REFS), and we will not attempt to review those here.
More interesting in this context is how these shape differences in the climatic sensitivity of growth and mortality.
Many observations of larger trees suffering more during drought (Bennett et al. 2015).
One likely mechanism behind this pattern is that the crowns of larger trees exist higher in the vertical profile and therefore are exposed to higher evaporative demand and solar radiation [@mcgregor_tree_nodate].
Although drought is primarily a hydraulic problem, lack of water --> lower gs --> higher leaf T, so leaves face tradeoffs of water loss vs potentially damaging leafT.

**There is also recently emerging evidence that understory trees tend to exhibit greater growth declines with $T_{air}$ under mesic conditions.** 
In eight forests across the northeast United States, growth rates of understory trees declined sharply at higher $T_{air}$ (Rollinson et al., in review).
Similarly, our previously unpublished analysis shows that in a broadleaf deciduous forest in Virginia, understory trees in a Mid-Atlantic forest responded more negatively to warmer $T_{air}$ than did canopy trees (Fig. **4**; Appendix `r appendix_SCBI_treering`). 
This pattern is initially counter-intuitive in that sun-exposed leaves can experience greater elevation of $T_{leaf}$ over $T_{air}$ than shade leaves (Fig. **3?**). 
However, given adequate moisture to sustain high $g_s$, canopy leaves exposed to more wind and lower humidity should be more effective at cooling when $T_{air}$ exceeds physiological optima (Fig. **3**).
It is also possible that competition is accelerated under warmer temperatures.

## Implications for Modeling / Scaling / Future Climate Projections 

Elsa--The content below could probably be integrated in the above [Ecosystem Scale Implications] section, with subsections focusing on: 
-	Suggested implications at the ecosystem scale based on literature
-	How do models currently integrate or not integrate these concepts and dynamics
-	What major gaps in knowledge and/or important questions emerge from this review (i.e. a lot of focus on droughts justifiably, but understanding heterogeneous impacts of temperature increases on forest ecosystems, particularly at vertically resolved scales is also important.)
-	What does that mean for about ability to predict/understand how forest ecosystems will respond in the future?

E.g. see de Pury & Farquhar, 1997 : though likely an improvement over 'big-leaf' models, models that separate the canopy into sunlit and shaded portions (sun/shade models) may not be able to capture important within-canopy variation in terms of leaf dynamics (e.g. seasonal shifts in vertical leaf area distributions, Smith et al. 2019) and functions (e.g. thermal responses, as we present in this paper). Hence, multi-layered ecosystem models may be necessary for accurately projecting future forest function.

[@nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017]--> modelling ideas?
