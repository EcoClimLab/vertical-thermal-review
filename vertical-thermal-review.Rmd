Rising temperatures are having profound effects on forests; however, it is not well understood how responses vary vertically across forest strata. Here, we review how environmental conditions, leaf temperatures,  and foliar traits and metabolism vary across vertical gradients, shaping whole-tree ecology and ecosystem function. In forests with dense canopies, canopy leaves are exposed to higher solar radiation and evaporative demand than understory leaves, and are therefore at risk of elevated leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$), particularly when transpirational cooling is curtailed by limited stomatal conductance.  However, foliar traits relevant to shaping $T_{leaf}$ also vary strongly across height or light gradients, partially offsetting the propensity towards elevated $T_{leaf}$ in the upper canopy. Leaf metabolism generally increases with height across the vertical gradient, and tall trees have higher metabolism and growth at both individual and ecosystem levels. Yet, differences in thermal sensitivity and damage thresholds are modest. The implications for tree performance are mixed: whereas larger trees face disproportionate stress during drought, understory trees have fewer cooling mechanisms and may be stifled under hot, humid conditions. As warming continues, large canopy trees will be particularly vulnerable to drought, whereas understory trees will suffer most when the buffering provided by large trees is lost.

# Introduction

**Forest responses and feedbacks to climate change will have a critical influence on the future of Earth's climate.**
Globally, temperatures have risen $1.2^\circ$C since 1900 [@rohdeBerkeleyEarthLand2020] and are expected to rise over pre-industrial levels of $1.6 - 4.3^{\circ}$C by 2100 (IPCC 2014), accompanied by increasing severity and frequency of heat waves [@meehlMoreIntenseMore2004] and hotter droughts [@trenberthGlobalWarmingChanges2014b].
These changes are expected to have profound effects on tree metabolism and forest ecosystem function [@breshearsUnderappreciatedPlantVulnerabilities2021; IPBES report], including altered rates of photosynthesis and respiration [@breshearsUnderappreciatedPlantVulnerabilities2021; @corlettImpactsWarmingTropical2011], foliar damage during heat waves [@osullivanThermalLimitsLeaf2017; @corlettImpactsWarmingTropical2011], and reduced growth and elevated mortality during drought [@teskeyResponsesTreeSpecies2015; @rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory; @breshearsUnderappreciatedPlantVulnerabilities2021; @mcdowellPervasiveShiftsForest2020]. Collectively, these impacts may lead to reduced forest C sequestration, as may already be occurring in some forests [@oishiWarmerTemperaturesReduce2018; @sullivanLongtermThermalSensitivity2020]. The resulting feedbacks to the climate system, carbon storage, and changes in albedo and hydrology will in turn have a critical influence on the future trajectory of climate change [@bonan_ecological_2016], yet this influence remains extremely uncertain [@krauseLargeUncertaintyCarbon2018; @friedlingsteinClimateCarbonCycle2006].
 
**Rising temperatures are likely to have differential impacts on trees of different size and canopy position, in large part because small understory trees exist in a microenvironment that is substantially buffered by the more exposed canopy trees [@zellweger_seasonal_2019; @davisMicroclimaticBufferingForests2019].**
Forests are vertically and horizontally stratified, with trees of different sizes through various successional stages. 
Overstory trees form canopies that play a crucial role in moderating forest climatic conditions [@ozanneBiodiversityMeetsAtmosphere2003; @nakamuraForestsTheirCanopies2017], including understory microclimates by buffering extreme temperatures, solar insolation, wind, and other meteorological conditions [@zellweger_seasonal_2019]. This creates a vertical stratification of the biophysical environment such as temperature, light, wind, humidity and CO~2~ concentrations that influences leaf traits, thermoregulation and metabolism along the gradient, with implications for whole plant performance [@fauset_differences_2018; @michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016].
Despite the fact that this vertical gradient inevitably shapes nearly every aspect of plant metabolism, demography, and ecology, we lack comprehensive understanding of these gradients [but see @niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004b].
Importantly, this limits our ability to understand how warming temperatures will affect leaf-level metabolism, whole-plant performance, and, in turn, forest ecosystem dynamics, biodiversity, energy balance, ecosystem function, and biosphere-atmosphere interactions.


**Here, we review how the biophysical environment and plant form and function vary across the vertical canopy gradient in forests.** 
We focus on five key themes (Fig. `r fig_schematic`):
(1) the biophysical environment;
(2) leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$);
(3) the leaf traits that most strongly influence $T_{leaf}$ and metabolism;
(4) foliar metabolism, including stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, respiration, and volatile organic compound (VOC) production; and 
(5) the size-structuring of whole-tree and ecosystem function.
*We then consider the implications for understanding forest responses to global change, including how these responses scale across space and time.*

# Review of vertical gradients

## The biophysical environment

**The biophysical environment, defined here to include the physical structure of the vegetation and associated physical conditions, varies across the vertical gradient from the forest floor to the top of the canopy (Figs. `r fig_schematic`, `r fig_NEON_vertical`), with physical conditions in large part determined by the structure of the forest.** 
In this section, we supplement a review of the existing literature with a new analysis of data on vegetation structure and vertical microclimate profiles from the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network [NEON; Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`-`r SIfig_NEON_all`; Appendix `r appendix_NEON_methods`, @schimelNEONHierarchicallyDesigned2007].
While the focus here is on vertical gradients, it is important to note that in heterogeneous canopies with high gap fractions and large variation in tree height, or at forest edges, the biophysical environment can be more closely linked to the distance from the outer canopy than to height [@lowmanForestCanopies1995]. 

![**Figure `r fig_NEON_vertical`. Vertical gradients in the biophysical environment for six sites in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)**. Height profiles from the growing season are shown for: (a) leaf area density, (b) proportion sun leaves, (c) proportion light incidence, and July mean ± 1 standard deviation for (d) maximum photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), (e) maximum wind speed, (f) minimum humidity, (g) maximum $T_{air}$, and (h) maximum biological temperature, $T_{bio}$. Sites include a tropical montane broadleaf evergreen forest (Pu‘u Maka‘ala Natural Area Reserve, Hawaii; PUUM), a subtropical longleaf pine savanna (Ordway-Swisher Biological Station, FL; OSBS), two temperate broadleaf forests (Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, VA, SCBI; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, MD, SERC), and a mixed northern hardwood and coniferous forest (Harvard Forest, MA; HARV). Vertical profiles in micrometeorological variables (d-h) at all NEON sites are shown in Fig. S1.](NEON_height_profiles/figures/profile_all.png)

**Canopy foliage acts as the primary physical barrier between the atmosphere and the forest floor, buffering multiple aspects of the understory conditions. It is critical in influencing -- and is influenced by -- the vertical biophysical gradient (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`).**
Foliage distribution is structured in correspondence with the distribution of tree sizes and tree architecture within a forest, where leaf area density (LAD; *i.e.*, leaf area per unit volume) patterns along the vertical gradient are heterogeneous across forests (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a-b, `r SIfig_NEON_all`). 
Dense canopy forests composed of broadleaf trees can have high LAD in the upper canopy layers, as well as in the understory (e.g., SCBI, SERC and HARV, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a) -- a pattern also common in tropical forests [@ashtonComparisonsStructureMixed1992; @koikeCanopyStructureTropical1993].
In temperate forests, although LAD is generally more concentrated in the upper-canopy, undualting patterns are formed by conifers and top vs. bottom heavy foliage trees, and sometimes by dense understories [e.g., SCBI, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a, @parkerVerticalProfileCanopy1989; @terborghVerticalComponentPlant1985; @ishiiExploringRelationshipsCanopy2004a; @parkerCanopyLightTransmittance2002]. 
In open canopy forests, including many needle-leaf forests, LAD can be predominantly accumulated in the lower canopy layers [e.g., PUUM and WREF, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`a, @hanberryOpenForestEcosystems2020a; @lawLeafAreaDistribution2001; @baldocchiSeasonalVariationEnergy1997; @bonan_ecological_2016; @ishiiExploringRelationshipsCanopy2004a]. 
Soil moisture conditions, topography, and gap formations following disturbances all alter foliage patterns and further influence the formation of closed vs. open canopy forests [e.g., @almeidaContrastingFireDamage2016; @starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020; @bonan_ecological_2016; @hanberryOpenForestEcosystems2020a]. 
In addition, seasonally dry and wet conditions, deciduousness, and phenology contribute to temporally shifting LAD patterns [@parkerStructuralPhenologyLeaf2004; @smithSeasonalDroughtrelatedChanges2019 ; @parkerConsequencesEnvironmentalHeterogeneity2019]. 
In this review, we focus on growing season conditions (peak LAD) unless otherwise noted.

**Light, specifically the proportion of incident light and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), decreases from canopy tops to the forest floor, with the profile shape modified by LAD, canopy height, canopy structure, and across species and forest types [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`b-d, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, @koike_leaf_2001].** 
This gradient is more pronounced under dense canopies, including broad-leaf and mixed forests (e.g., SCBI, SERC and HARV, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`d), than under open canopy forests, including many conifer forests [e.g., OSBS, PUUM, and WREF, Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`d, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, @aussenacInteractionsForestStands2000a; Smith et al., 2019; Tymen et al., 2017; @chazdonPhotosyntheticLightEnvironments1984; @parkerConsequencesEnvironmentalHeterogeneity2019; @bartemucciOverstoryInfluencesLight2006; @baldocchiSeasonalVariationEnergy1997]. 
Variability in the light environment decreases with height, with the shaded understory being highly influenced by sunflecks, or brief increases in solar radiation caused by small canopy gaps and wind-induced canopy movements [@waySunflecksTreesForests2012]. 

**Wind speeds are also higher at the top of the canopy, owing to the effect of turbulence buffering with canopy height [@juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018].**
Wind speeds increase with height across forest types from closed-canopy forests [@barnardSeasonalVariationCanopy2016a; @mcgregorTreeHeightLeaf2021; @juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018] to open forests and savannas [@curtis_intracanopy_2019; @mullerEvidenceEfficientNonevaporative2021; @hanberryOpenForestEcosystems2020a; @hanberryReconceptualizationOpenOak2018], including all 22 forested NEON sites (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`e, `r SIfig_NEON_all`). 
Specifically, across the NEON sites, July maximum daily wind speeds averaged up to 4.1 m s^-1^ higher at the top of the vertical profile than the bottom, where maximum wind speeds averaged $\le$ 1.1 m s^-1^ (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`).
The implication is that upper canopy leaves have substantially higher boundary layer conductance ($g_a$) and associated potential for both water and heat loss (see next section).

**Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) and water vapor can also vary across the vertical gradient.**
Atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations tend to be higher near the ground at night, associated with plant and soil respiration, although the elevated CO~2~ quickly dissipates during the day [@koike_leaf_2001; @yang_spatial_1999]. Elevated CO~2~ may benefit understory seedlings operating close to their carbon compensation point, but given that differences are negligible for most of the day when photosynthesis is occurring, gradients in CO~2~ concentrations are unlikely to significantly affect the energy balance and metabolism of leaves across the forest vertical gradient.

Relative humidity (RH) tends to be higher in the understory and decreases with height, although this trend is absent in open forests [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`f, `r SIfig_NEON_all`, e.g., @mcgregorTreeHeightLeaf2021; @juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018].
Dense-canopy forests maintain higher daily maximum RH in the understory than open forests and nearby open areas, an effect that is greater in wetter conditions, and warmer months [@vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a; @hanberryOpenForestEcosystems2020a]. 
In combination with $T_{air}$, RH determines vapor pressure deficit (VPD) -- the driving force of water loss from leaves, which tends to be greater in upper-canopy and canopy gaps than in the understory [@fauset_differences_2018; @tymenQuantifyingMicroenvironmentalVariation2017; @niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004b]. Especially when canopy height and leaf area index (LAI) are large, maximum Tair and VPD are reduced in the understory [@juckerCanopyStructureTopography2018].

**Air temperature ($T_{air}$) often shows little variation across the vertical gradient, but under certain circumstances it can be significantly buffered by forest canopies (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`).**
The $T_{air}$ gradient from the canopy to the understory varies with factors such as radiation fluxes, local topography, vertical air mixing, cloud cover and vegetation type [@defrenneForestMicroclimatesClimate2021]. 
Typically, dense canopies buffer understories from high maximum $T_{air}$ more than open canopies -- *i.e.*, dense canopy understories can have cooler maximum daytime $T_{air}$ and warmer nighttime minimum $T_{air}$ than open canopy understories or nearby clearings [@missonPartitioningForestCarbon2007; @defrenneForestMicroclimatesClimate2021; @vonarxSpatiotemporalEffectsForest2012a; @defrenneGlobalBufferingTemperatures2019; @davisMicroclimaticBufferingForests2019; @zellweger_seasonal_2019; @ramboCanopyMicroclimateResponse2009]. 
Notably, this pattern can be reversed in open forests, where below-canopy maximum $T_{air}$ can be warmer than canopy $T_{air}$ due to turbulent air mixing and the thermal radiative flux from the soil and the canopy that is intercepted by lower-canopy layers, analogous to a 'canopy greenhouse effect' [e.g., OSBS, Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`g, `r SIfig_NEON_all`b, @banerjeeExplainingConvectorEffect2017; @curtis_intracanopy_2019;@zweifelMiddayStomatalClosure2002; @hadleyInfluenceKrummholzMat1987; @ramboCanopyMicroclimateResponse2009; @hardwickRelationshipLeafArea2015].    

## Leaf temperature 

Leaf temperature ($T_{leaf}$) is strongly tied to $T_{air}$, and is further influenced by other biophysical drivers (reviewed above) and by leaf traits and stomatal conductance (see following sections) with leaves adjusting to their environment to maintain, when possible, an optimal $T_{leaf}$ for carbon assimilation and metabolic processes [@michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015; @perezPhotosyntheticHeatTolerances2020; @drakeNoEvidenceHomeostatic2020]. 
Leaves can be cooler than the air at high $T_{air}$ or warmer than air at low $T_{air}$ (limited homeothermy), and may sometimes be drastically warmer than $T_{air}$ [megathermy, @doughtyAreTropicalForests2008].
While $T_{leaf}$ is rarely exactly equal to $T_{air}$ (poikilothermy), it is most commonly within a few degrees [@cavaleriColdbloodedForestsWarming2020; @drakeNoEvidenceHomeostatic2020]. 


### Biophysical drivers

**Fundamentally, $T_{leaf}$ is determined by the energy balance of a leaf and can be estimated based via biophysical principles, where $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$ is a function of energy input from radiation minus heat lost to the environment [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`, @campbell_introduction_1998; @muir_tealeaves_2019; @michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016; @michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015].**
The dominant component of a leaf's energy balance is net radiation ($R_n$, including shortwave and longwave). High radiation loads can elevate $T_{leaf}$ dramatically above $T_{air}$ (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`a).
Generally, the dominant avenue of heat loss to the environment is latent heat flux, wherein the loss of energy required to convert water from a liquid to a vapour state during evaporation and transpiration cools the leaf. 
Latent heat flux ($\lambda E$) is controlled primarily by stomatal and boundary layer conductances, $g_s$ and $g_a$, and by the water vapour concentration difference between the leaf surface and the bulk air.
Therefore, $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$ decreases with $g_a$, which in turn increases with wind speed [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b,@daudetWindSpeedLeaf1999a]; decreases with leaf size (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`d);
decreases with $g_s$ (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`e);
and increases with VPD, or increases with RH (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`c).

![**Figure `r fig_leaf_T`. Theoretical expectations for variation in the elevation of $T_{leaf}$ above $T_{air}$ in response to (a) shortwave radiation, (b) wind speed, (c) relative humidity, (d) leaf width, and (e) stomatal conductance.** Leaf temperatures were modeled using the tealeaves R package of @muir_tealeaves_2019 parameterized to represent typical conditions for a broadleaf species (*Quercus rubra*) in a mesic temperate forest (Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA), as detailed in Appendix `r appendix_tealeaves_methods`. [ISSUE #6](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/6).](leaf_energy_balance/leaf_energy_fig3.png)

**Leaf energy balance is a tradeoff between water-use strategy and optimum $T_{leaf}$ [@fauset_differences_2018; @kochDiurnalPatternsLeaf1994].** 
When $g_s$ is high, high $\lambda E$ facilitates heat dissipation. 
However, when leaf water demand (influenced by VPD and photosynthetic CO~2~ demand) exceeds the rate of supply, conservation of water ($g_s$-limitation) occurs at the cost of increasing $T_{leaf}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`e, @fauset_differences_2018].
Therefore, while under maximum $g_s$, leaves can maintain $T_{leaf}$ closer to $T_{air}$ at high solar radiation loads, during $g_s$- limitation solar radiation can drastically elevate $T_{leaf}$ above $T_{air}$, especially for larger leaves [@fauset_differences_2018; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @konradLeafTemperatureIts2021].
With adequate water, species with smaller leaves (higher $g_a$) and larger $g_s$ will be most effective at cooling during high temperatures [@songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @dongBiophysicalHomoeostasisLeaf2017; @konradLeafTemperatureIts2021; @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @leuzingerTreeSpeciesDiversity2007].

**Vertical gradients**

**These basic biophysical principles shape the propensity for $T_{leaf}$ to be elevated above $T_{air}$ across vertical gradients in closed-canopy forests.**
High radiation at the top of the vertical profile (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) implies that canopy leaves have much greater propensity for high $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$, such that they would be expected to be warmer than understory leaves under most conditions (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`).
However, higher wind speeds (e.g., up to ~ 4 $ms^{-1}$ at NEON sites; Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) are capable of lowering $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$ upto ~ $4^\circ$C [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b, @bonan_ecological_2016; @niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004b]. Collectively, higher wind speed (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`), and with adaptive leaf traits increase $g_a$ and $g_s$ (reviewed below) mediate the direct effects of solar radiation on upper canopy leaves (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`a) and result in higher rates of heat loss (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b-e). In contrast, greater RH and lower wind speeds in the understory may stifle $\lambda E$ (through reduced $g_s$ and $g_a$), thereby increasing $T_{leaf}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`, @perezIncreasingHumidityThreatens2018; @tibbittsHumidityPlants1979b].

**Vertical $T_{leaf}$ gradients are also expected to vary with canopy structure (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`).**
Closed canopies with high LAI act as an umbrella, absorbing most of the incoming radiation and preventing vertical air mixing in the understory. The intensity of incoming radiation and VPD in the upper canopy, combined with hydraulic challenges of water transport to the tops of tall trees [**REFS**] can cause $g_s$-limitation. Therefore, we would expect a stronger $T_{leaf}$ gradient where upper canopy leaves can reach much warmer temperatures than lower canopies layers [@millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021]. In contrast, open canopies with lower canopy LAI allow more vertical air mixing and sunlight into the understory. This mixing and light penetration can either neutralize a $T_{leaf}$ gradient or elevate $T_{leaf}-T_{air}$ in the lower canopy relative to the upper canopy. The latter can result from the 'canopy greenhouse effect' or sunflecks, as mentioned above [@hardwickRelationshipLeafArea2015; @schymanskiStomatalControlLeaf2013b], and because shade leaves tend to have lower $g_s$ and greater thermal capacitance [capacity to hold heat, @schymanskiStomatalControlLeaf2013b]. 

**Within closed-canopy forests vertical gradients, the propensity for $T_{leaf}$ to be elevated above $T_{air}$ are expected to vary with micrometeorological conditions (Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`).**
Under drought conditions (hot and dry, with higher-than-average solar radiation), when $g_s$ is limiting, there will be a propensity for $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ to be elevated in the canopy compared to the understory (Fig.`r fig_leaf_T`).
Because sun leaves are exposed to higher irradiance and VPD, their $g_s$-limitation is steeper than shade leaves, resulting in greater increases in $T_{leaf}$ when $g_s$ is reduced [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`e, @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @fauset_differences_2018]. 
In contrast, under hot and wet conditions, higher wind speeds and $g_a$ enable cooling. Under lower wind conditions, the thickness of the air layer at the leaf surface curbs rapid leaf-to-air heat transfer, limiting $g_a$ and increasing $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`b, @martin_boundary_1999; @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @robertsStomatalBoundaryLayerConductances1990a; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020]. 
Thus, while understory and within-canopy shade leaves can remain cooler under lower radiation, their environment is not conducive to shedding excess heat, which in combination with their physiological propensities can result in greater $T_{leaf}$ under slight heat stress [@leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @schymanskiStomatalControlLeaf2013b; @zweifelMiddayStomatalClosure2002].
Understory leaves, which typically experience lower windspeeds (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`), would retain more heat.
Higher RH conditions in the understory (Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`) would also inhibit cooling, as $\lambda E$ is stifled under high RH, resulting in  greater $T_{leaf}$-$T_{air}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`c, @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020; @tibbittsHumidityPlants1979b; @perezIncreasingHumidityThreatens2018; @konradLeafTemperatureIts2021].


### In situ observations

**Following the principles outlined above, vertical microclimate profiles, leaf traits, and $g_s$ together explain *in situ* $T_{leaf}$ observations.** 
Often, $T_{leaf}$ tracks $T_{air}$, *in large part due to vertical gradients in leaf traits and $g_s$,* and therefore differs little between understory and canopy.
In forests with dense canopies, including tropical and temperate broadleaf forests, leaves experience greater $T_{leaf} - T_{air}$ and higher maximum $T_{leaf}$ in the upper canopies than buffered lower-canopies. In some cases canopy leaves exceed the optima for photosynthesis ($T_{opt}$) and $T_{air}$ because of $g_s$-limitation and high solar radiation loads [@carterExperimentalWarmingTropical2021; @niinemetsShapeLeafPhotosynthetic1999; @doughtyAreTropicalForests2008; @fauset_differences_2018; @mauTemperateTropicalForest2018a; @millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021; @rey-sanchez_spatial_2016; @mauTemperateTropicalForest2018a; @rey-sanchez_spatial_2016; @pauTropicalForestTemperature2018]. 
In contrast, in open forests with lower LAI, lower-canopy $T_{leaf}$ can equal or even exceed upper canopy $T_{leaf}$, due to greater light permeability, vertical air mixing, and still air in the lower canopy and heating from the ground [Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`h, `r SIfig_NEON_all`b,e, @mullerEvidenceEfficientNonevaporative2021; @martin_boundary_1999; @zweifelMiddayStomatalClosure2002; @hadleyInfluenceKrummholzMat1987]. 
Similarly, in very open forests or savannas, trees growing close to the ground can experience greater heat stress in their lower than upper canopies [@hadleyInfluenceKrummholzMat1987; @curtis_intracanopy_2019; @johnstonWhatLiesVertical2020 (in review)]. 
Greater $RH$ in the inner canopy can also increase $T_{leaf}$ relative to upper canopy $T_{leaf}$ [@dietzVerticalPatternsDuration2007]. 

It is noteworthy that $T_{leaf}$ often differs substantially from branch and stem temperatures. For instance, exposed tropical tree bark can be much warmer than leaves and flowers [@pauTropicalForestTemperature2018; @stillImagingCanopyTemperature2021]. 
Thus, the vegetation temperature ($T_{veg}$) measured using sensors that integrate across both leaves and woody vegetation (e.g., infrared sensors for $T_{veg}$ at NEON sites, Fig. `r fig_NEON_vertical`h) does not always equal $T_{leaf}$, particularly in settings where leaf area is low relative to woody vegetation (*i.e.*, low-LAI ecosystems and understories). 
Recent advances in $T_{leaf}$ modeling (see "Scaling across Space and Time") will enhance our understanding of large scale $T_{leaf}$ vertical patterns [@stillImagingCanopyTemperature2021].

## Leaf traits 

**Leaf traits determine the capacity of leaves to thermoregulate [@michaletzEnergeticCarbonEconomic2016], and as such are critical to optimizing leaf metabolism across forest vertical strata [@michaletzPlantThermoregulationEnergetics2015; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004].**
Leaf morphology adjusts to the local microenvironment during leaf expansion [@zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004], and the ratio of direct to diffused light and associated water demands determines the differentiation of traits of sun and shade leaves [@casasSunShadeLeaves2011; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004; @keenanGlobalLeafTrait2016]. 
This dichotomy in leaves is observed along the vertical gradient where canopy-leaves vary dramatically from canopy-interior and understory due to the differences in biophysical conditions (Figs. `r fig_NEON_vertical`, `r SIfig_NEON_all`). 

Across the vertical gradient, traits vary (1) across sun and shade leaves within individuals, (2) across canopy and understory individuals of the same species, and (3) across canopy and understory species. 
The majority of studies characterizing variation in leaf traits or metabolism examine intraspecific patterns (categories 1 and 2), which are therefore the main focus of this review (Table 1).
However, when it comes to understanding and modeling forest ecosystem function, given that species traits strongly shape the propensity for trees to inhabit understory vs. canopy positions, interspecific variation shapes ecosystem function is interspecific (e.g., *Lamour, Serbin in prep*).


### Intraspecific variation

Within-canopy, leaf traits vary along the vertical light gradient [*i.e.,* sun and shade leaves, @casasSunShadeLeaves2011] at an anatomical, structural and biochemical level [Table `r table_leaf_traits`, @sackHowStrongIntracanopy2006; @niinemetsWorldwideAnalysisWithincanopy2015; @chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020]. 
As much of our understanding of trait coordination is based on the leaf economics spectrum concept (@wrightWorldwideLeafEconomics2004) which was developed using sun leaves [@chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020; @keenanGlobalLeafTrait2016], further research is needed to characterize trait relationships and responses vertically through the canopy. 
It has been established that independent of the light environment, traits also vary within species along the ontogenetic trajectory from the understory to the canopy. For example, LMA, photosynthetic capacity (per area) and $g_s$ have been observed to increase with height, separate from light [@thomasPhotosyntheticDifferencesSaplings2002; @houterOntogeneticChangesLeaf2012; @cavender-baresChangesDroughtResponse2000]. Therefore, ontogeny is bound to play a role in thermal sensitivity [@carterExperimentalWarmingTropical2021; @niinemetsResponsesForestTrees2010a].

#### (Anatomical, Morphological and Physiological traits)

Sun leaves have traits that reduce heat and water stress -- for instance, by being smaller, hairier, having higher vein density [Table 1, @leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @vogelSunLeavesShade1968a; @sackHowStrongIntracanopy2006; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004;@mathurPhotosyntheticEfficiencySun2018a], and a steeper leaf-angle [@niinemetsAdjustmentFoliageStructure1998, *REF*]. These traits collectively aid heat dissipation and regulate $T_{leaf}$-photosynthetic balance. In contrast, shade leaves have traits that maximize light capture in the diffuse-light environment with sunflecks (e.g., lower LMA), but they are more likely to overheat than sun leaves due to greater thermal capacitance [@leighInfluenceLeafSize2017; @casasSunShadeLeaves2011; @schymanskiStomatalControlLeaf2013b]. In open canopies, where light is comparatively homogeneous, exposed leaves are primarily shaped by $T_{air_{max}}$ and VPD stress, rather than solely by light [@mediavillaFoliarPlasticityRelated2019a].

#### (Biochemical and elemental traits, and isoprene)

Elemental traits, such as $N_{area}$ and $P_{area}$, contribute to activities of high leaf metabolism, including respiration [@meirLeafRespirationTwo2001;@weerasingheCanopyPositionAffects2014] and photosynthetic processes in sun leaves [Table 1, @scartazzaInvestigatingEuropeanBeech2016; @niinemetsWithincanopyVariationRate2004a; @weerasingheCanopyPositionAffects2014]. Within-canopy leaf nitrogen distribution can be regulated to prevent photoinhibition in shade leaves during sunflecks, and direct light for sun leaves [@kitaoCanopyNitrogenDistribution2018]. Therefore, we would expect elemental traits to influence vertical foliar thermal sensitivity;  however, @zhuPlasticityPhotosyntheticHeat2018 and @osullivanThermalLimitsLeaf2017 observed no relation between foliar thermal tolerance and total foliar concentrations of N and P.

Biochemical protection against foliage light and heat damage also increases with irradiance, and thus tends to be higher in the upper canopy than in the understory (Table 1). 
Carotenoids and xanthophyll cycle pigments -- violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin (VAZ) -- can play a role in antioxidant scavenging and converting excess excitation energy into heat to reduce photoinhibition [@niinemetsPhotosynthesisResourceDistribution2007a; @mathurPhotosyntheticEfficiencySun2018a; @niinemetsAcclimationHighIrradiance1998]. The dissipation of excess light energy is also important for leaf acclimation to higher temperatures if high $T_{leaf}$ impairs the photochemical energy dissipation pathway [@havauxTemperaturedependentAdjustmentThermal1996]. Heat-sensitive emissions of isoprene gas from tree leaves enhance photosynthetic thermal tolerance by regulating antioxidant defences and other metabolic processes [@sharkeyIsopreneEmissionPlants2008; @taylorCapacityEmitIsoprene2019a; @monsonLeafIsopreneEmission2021].

#### (Leaf lifecycles)

The vertical structure of microenvironments likely influences forest photosynthetic capacity and $T_{leaf}$ gradients [@rey-sanchez_spatial_2016] via leaf phenology. For example, deciduousness is an adaptation to conserve water during dry periods [@meakemRoleTreeSize2018], but is also structured across the vertical profile. Within tropical deciduous species, the fraction of seasonally deciduous individuals increases toward larger tree size classes in hotter, brighter environments, with understory individuals typically remaining evergreen [@conditQuantifyingDeciduousnessTropical2000c]. Even in evergreen forests, environmental variation alters leaf age distributions [@albertCrypticPhenologyPlants2019], which affects forest photosynthetic capacity [@wuLeafDevelopmentDemography2016; @niinemetsLeafAgeDependent2016] and heat stress via age-specific leaf function [@albertCrypticPhenologyPlants2019]. For instance, in tropical evergreen forests, because leaf turnover rates of sun leaves in the upper canopy is faster than in the subcanopy, less damage accumulates [@millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021]. Leaf age affects vulnerability to heat stress and has a strong effect on metabolism  [@mariasImpactsLeafAge2017; @zhouLeafageEffectsTemperature2015; @kikuzawaSynthesisRelationshipsLeaf2006], and can be expected to similarly scale through vertically structured phenology to affect forest responses to heat anomalies.

### Interspecific variation 

Vertical gradients in the biophysical environment shape which plant strategies, or sets of traits, are competitive in canopy versus understory conditions, thereby shaping community composition across size classes. 
Generally, the pattern of fundamental trait adaptations to light gradients across forest species is similar to within-canopy traits [@rozendaalPlasticityLeafTraits2006; @thomasPhotosyntheticDifferencesSaplings2002; @houterOntogeneticChangesLeaf2012]. 
For instance, across increasing tree size classes, there is an increase in the fractions of species that are deciduous [@conditQuantifyingDeciduousnessTropical2000c; @meakemRoleTreeSize2018].
However, the range in trait values can be several times greater in multi-species canopy than in understory species, based on their inherent species-specific traits and responses to environmental conditions. 
Therefore, vertical gradients in $T_{leaf}$ and metabolism within forest ecosystems are underpinned by both intra- and inter-specific variation in traits. 

## Leaf metabolism and thermal responses

Leaf metabolism is strongly shaped by $T_{leaf}$, and by the traits and environmental drivers reviewed above, all of which vary across vertical forest gradients (Fig. `r fig_schematic`). 
However, as we detail below, few studies have evaluated temperature responses of leaf metabolic rates along a vertical canopy gradient, or compared sun and shade leaves (Table `r table_leaf_metabolism`).

### Stomatal conductance

Maximum $g_s$ increases with light environment, and is thus higher in the sun exposed upper canopy than in sub-canopy or understory leaves (Table 2). However, because of the high VPD and irradiance experienced by sun leaves,  midday stomatal depression is more prevalent in sun leaves than shade leaves in closed-canopy forests.  $T_{leaf}$ of sun leaves thus further increases due to the lack of transpirational cooling [@sanchesDifferentialLeafTraits2010; @zwienieckiHydraulicLimitationsImposed2004; @kochDiurnalPatternsLeaf1994; @kosugiSeasonalFluctuationsTemperature2006]. In open forests, midday stomatal closure can occur in both upper canopy and lower canopy leaves, with stomata of lower canopy leaves remaining closed for a longer duration than upper canopy leaves, resulting in elevated $T_{leaf}$ [Fig. `r fig_leaf_T`,@zweifelMiddayStomatalClosure2002]. The temperature at which $g_s$ is maximized, $T_{opt}$ of $g_s$, did not differ significantly between sun and shade leaves in three tropical tree species [@slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019a], sun leaves in the upper canopy show a stronger decrease in $g_s$ in response to rising $T_{air}$ than do shade leaves in the lower canopy [@hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020; @carterExperimentalWarmingTropical2021]. 

### Photosynthesis

**Photosynthetic capacity is generally higher in exposed canopy positions-- a fact that is both theoretically expected and observed in numerous field studies (Table 2; Niinemets 2007 ; Kenzo et al. 2015 ; Slot et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020).**
This is primarily driven by the greater light available to sun leaves, which also have traits enabling higher photosynthetic rates under high light and sufficient nutrient and water conditions (Table 1, Table 2). 

Temperature can affect photosynthesis via direct and indirect pathways--directly, by altering photosynthetic enzyme activity and the electron transport chain, and indirectly through increased VPD causing stomatal closure [@lloydEffectsRisingTemperatures2008]. Photosynthesis has a peaked response to $T_{air}$, with the peak commonly found to corresponding to the prevalent ambient growing season conditions [@tanOptimumAirTemperature2017; @slotSituTemperatureResponse2017; @doughtyAreTropicalForests2008]. Beyond the optimum, photosynthesis decreases as a result of stomatal closure [e.g. @slotSituTemperatureResponse2017; @smithEmpiricalEvidenceResilience2020; @grossiordPlantResponsesRising2020; @fredeenTemperatureHumidityEffects1999], and eventually due to biochemical constraints [@kumarathungeAcclimationAdaptationComponents2019a; @sageTemperatureResponseC32007; @varhammarPhotosyntheticTemperatureResponses2015; @sharkeyEffectsModerateHeat2005].

**We have very little evidence as to how the temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis compares between sun and shade leaves.**
Based on consistent positive relationships between growth temperature and temperature optimum of photosynthesis ($T_{opt}$) across sites and seasons [e.g. @tanOptimumAirTemperature2017; @kumarathungeAcclimationAdaptationComponents2019a], one might expect sun leaves to have a stronger temperature-dependence and higher temperature optima than shade leaves [Campbell and Norman 1998; @niinemetsShapeLeafPhotosynthetic1999; @niinemetsPhotosyntheticAcclimationSimultaneous2004b]. However, such a trend is not apparent among recent studies, where for three species in Panama, the $T_{opt}$ for sun leaves tended to be moderately, but not significantly, higher than that of shade leaves [@slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019a; @hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020]. Similarly, $T_{opt}$ of the RuBP carboxylation  ($V_{max}$) and regeneration rates ($J_{max}$) did not differ systematically between tropical sun and shade leaves [@hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020], and along vertical gradients of tropical and temperate trees [@mau_temperate_2018; @millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021;@mau_temperate_2018]. In contrast, tropical experimental warming observations showed that $T_{opt}$, and $T_{opt}$ of $J_{max}$ decrease from the understory to the canopy, potentially linked to greater thermal sensitivity of $g_s$ in upper canopy leaves [@carterExperimentalWarmingTropical2021]. 

@hernandezSimilarTemperatureDependence2020 also speculated that the observed lack of sun-shade differences in $T_{opt}$ may reflect acclimation to similar temperatures of peak photosynthesis. Sun leaves experience higher temperatures, but maximum temperatures are associated with conditions of midday stomatal depression, and acclimation to optimize photosynthesis at these temperatures would not be advantageous. Shade leaves that do not experience midday depression continue to fix carbon even when afternoon air temperatures peak [@millerOnlySunlitLeaves2021]. Evaluating this requires diurnal monitoring of net photosynthesis through the canopy.
 
**Leaf photosynthetic thermal tolerance**
Irreversible damage to photosystem II, leading to leaf necrosis and eventually leaf death, occurs at $T_{leaf}$ of $40-60^{\circ}C$ [@bakerChlorophyllFluorescenceProbe2008; @feeley_thermal_2020].Thermal tolerance is described in terms of the temperature at which efficiency of photosystem II starts to decrease, $T_{crit}$, and the $T_{leaf}$ at which efficiency of photosystem II had decreased by 50%, $T_{50}$ [@slotLeafHeatTolerance2020]. Thermal tolerance varies globally across latitude and climate, where $T_{50}$ and $T_{crit}$ decrease across latitudes, and with elevation among tropical forests [@feeley_thermal_2020;  @slotLeafHeatTolerance2021; @osullivanThermalLimitsLeaf2017].

Leaf thermal tolerances are more closely adapted to microclimate than macroclimate [@feeley_thermal_2020; @slotPhotosyntheticPlasticityTropical2021]. Chinquapin oak (*Quercus muehlenbergii*) growing in xeric, sunnier conditions showed higher $T_{50}$ by $2{^\circ}C$ than bur oak (*Quercus macrocarpa*) growing in shaded mesic conditions [@hamerlynckPhotosyntheticStomatalResponses1996a]. Along a vertical gradient within the canopy, *Acacia papyrocarpa* (Benth.) showed greater $T_{50}$ and higher composite climate stress in the lower, north-facing canopy than other canopy positions, correlating with low wind-speed, greater radiation and $T_{air}$, and lower rates of heat dissapation, as indicated by longer leaf thermal time constants [@curtis_intracanopy_2019]. Additionally, thermal tolerances are explained more by leaf traits than phylogeny [@feeley_thermal_2020; @slotPhotosyntheticPlasticityTropical2021]. $T_{crit}$ was found to be greater among tropical species with large leaves that had slow heating and cooling time, whereas $T_{50}$ was greater among species with greater LMA [@slotPhotosyntheticPlasticityTropical2021]. Across species sun leaves that experienced higher maximum temperatures show higher photosynthetic heat tolerance [@perezPhotosyntheticHeatTolerances2020]. However, considering sun and shade leaf differences within canopy (Table 1), $T_{50}$ varies modestly, being slightly lower for shade than sun leaves for two of three tree species in Panama [@slotPhotosyntheticHeatTolerance2019a]. We would expect leaves exposed to greater heat stress within the canopy to have higher heat tolerance, but further research is required to fully understand the relationship between heat tolerance, light exposure and microclimates.


### Respiration

**Similar to photosynthesis, respiration tends to be higher in canopy sun-leaves [Table 2, @chenLeafEconomicsSpectrum2020], but its temperature sensitivity ($Q_{10}$) shows no definite trend along the vertical gradient [@bolstad_foliar_1999; @weerasingheCanopyPositionAffects2014].** Specifically, the $Q_{10}$ of respiration can be constant within vertical profiles and in seedling sun vs. shade leaves [@carterExperimentalWarmingTropical; @weerasingheCanopyPositionAffects2014; @bolstad_foliar_1999; @zaragoza-castellsDoesGrowthIrradiance2007; @zaragoza-castellsClimatedependentVariationsLeaf2008; @xuSeasonalVariationTemperature2006], greater in upper-canopy leaves [@turnbullScalingFoliarRespiration2003; @harleyEffectsLightTemperature1996], or greater in the lower canopy [@griffinCanopyPositionAffects2002]. This may vary based on forest type [**REF**], leaf traits and leaf age, as in evergreen species, $Q_{10}$ has shown to be greater in younger than older leaves [@zhouLeafageEffectsTemperature2015]. Recent observations suggest that tropical understory leaves down-regulate $Q_{10}$ with rising $T_{air}$ [@carterExperimentalWarmingTropical2021]. 

### VOC production

**Isoprene production**
High emission rates occur in the mid-canopy, and even from very small statured trees, at a site in the Brazilian Amazon (Taylor et al., in prep).
The high temperature carbon compensation point of sun leaves is higher in isoprene emitting species than in non-emitting species, so it is to be expected that other aspects of heat tolerance will be similarly affected by isoprenes (https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13564). Within species, isporene production scales with light and temperature; together and independtly?

## Size-structuring within the ecosystem

**Differences across forest vertical gradients in biophysical conditions, plant traits, and metabolism scale up to affect whole-tree ecology, ecosystem ecology, and their temperature responses (Fig. `r fig_schematic`).** 


### Tree metabolism and growth, and survival

**Vertical gradients affect tree metabolism and growth.**
Whole-tree transpiration and gross primary production (GPP) increase in tandem with increasing tree size, where size is most commonly measured as diameter at breast height (DBH), but functionally linked to metrics such as foliage biomass, crown volume, or height, all of which scale with DBH [**REFS**, @anderson-teixeiraSizerelatedScalingTree2015].
Specifically, increases are linked to increased leaf area and in part to an increasing probability that the crown is in the canopy [@muller-landauTestingMetabolicEcology2006], where higher light availability and associated elevation of $g_s$ and $A_A$ result in higher leaf area-specific transpiration and photosynthesis (Table 2).
The net foliar photosynthate production is allocated among functions including respiration, woody growth, foliar turnover, belowground allocation, reproduction, defense, and storage of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs). 
The proportion of GPP allocated to many of these increases with tree size, including ... foliar respiration (Table 2), reproduction [**REFS**; @westIncreasingRespiratoryCosts2020].As a result of increasing C allocation to these other functions, mass-specific - and sometimes even absolute - woody growth rates decrease with tree size [**REFS**; @anderson-teixeiraJointEffectsClimate2021; @anderson-teixeiraCarbonCyclingMature2021].
However, NSC reserves increase with tree size, such that larger trees have relatively more buffer against biological and biophysical stressors [@niinemetsResponsesForestTrees2010a].



**Vertical gradients also affect the climate sensitivity of metabolism and growth.** 
Stomatal conductance tends to be more strongly limited by high atmospheric demand (high $T_{air}$ and VPD, low RH) than by low soil moisture [@novickIncreasingImportanceAtmospheric2016; @corlettImpactsWarmingTropical2011; @ruehrWaterAvailabilityDominant2016]. Therefore, periods of high atmospheric demand - be these on time scale of hours , days, or seasons - tend to cause greater reductions in whole-tree transpiration and photosynthesis in tall trees that occupy canopy positions in relatively dense-canopy forests [@christoffersenLinkingHydraulicTraits2016; @garciaImportanceHydraulicStrategy2021]. This is consistent with the observation that  $g_s$-limitation with $T_{air}$ increases with height in the canopy (Table 2). More active stomatal regulation of tall canopy trees [e.g., @mediavillaStomatalResponsesDrought2004]-- often combined with greater effective rooting depth--may offset greater xylem embolism risk [@olsonPlantHeightHydraulic2018; @garciaImportanceHydraulicStrategy2021; @chitra-tarakHydraulicallyvulnerableTreesSurvive] and lower capacity to adjust traits related to carbon metabolism to drought [@bartholomewSmallTropicalForest2020]. This results in decreasing carbon isotope discrimination, indicative of an increasingly conservative hydraulic strategy, with increasing tree height [Table 1, @mcdowellRelationshipTreeHeight2011].

The interannual climate sensitivity of annual woody growth can be determined through analysis of tree-ring increments.
While it is generally accepted that large, exposed trees display the greatest climate sensitivity and are therefore best for climate reconstructions [@frittsTreeRingsClimate1976], only a relatively limited number of studies have directly examined drought- or temperature-sensitivities as a function of tree size.
These have generally found greater sensitivity to low precipitation or high summer temperatures among larger, more exposed trees [**Fig. `r fig_treerings`**, @trouillierSizeMattersComparison2018; @gillerotTreeNeighbourhoodDiversity2020; @mcgregorTreeHeightLeaf2021; @anderson-teixeiraJointEffectsClimate2021], corroborating evidence from globally disurbed forest censuses that larger trees tend to undergo larger growth declines during drought [@bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015]. In addition to this lower drought resistance of growth, larger trees also frequently exhibit lower resilience [@mcgregorTreeHeightLeaf2021; **REF**] and greater increases in mortality [@bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015; @stovallTreeHeightExplains2019].
Despite the potential for shorter trees in open forests to experience greater environmental stress [**REFS**], this pattern has been observed in open as well as closed-canopy forests [@bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015; @anderson-teixeiraCarbonCyclingMature2021].

There are, however, exceptions to the pattern of greater growth reductions under high $T_{air}$ among larger trees.
In eight mesic forests across the northeast United States, tree-ring records showed steep growth declines of understory trees at higher $T_{air}$, contrasting with the responses of canopy trees [Fig `r fig_treerings`, @rollinsonClimateSensitivityUnderstory2021].
Potential mechanisms for these patterns include stifling of understory $\lambda E$ under still, humid conditions, resulting in above-optimal $T_{leaf}$ (Fig. 3) and lower photosynthesis, increases nighttime respiratory carbon loss that disroportionately reduced carbon availability for growth among small trees accelerated asymmetric competition. Additional research is required to understand these mechanisms and to disentangle tree growth responses to hot-wet versus hot-dry conditions.

Current figure shows (a) drought responses as a function of height in a temperate broadleaf forest (SCBI), from McGregor et al. 2020; (b) responses to growing season temperature in eight New England forests, from Rollinson et al. 2020.

### C and water flux

**Canopy trees account for the majority of forest ecosystem water and carbon cycling.**
While studies partitioning transpiration across forest vertical gradients are rare, both ET and transpiration have been shown to increase with height in a *Picea abies* forest in Germany, such that the upper half of the canopy contributed an estimated 80% of daytime ET [@staudtVerticalStructureEvapotranspiration2011]. Similarly, in a tropical forest in the Brazilian Amazon, canopy and subcanopy trees jointly contributed approximately 93% of ET, or 88% of transpiration (Fig 5a). In terms of C cycling, it has been estimated that canopy strata contribute ???64% of net daytime $CO_{2}$ uptake [i.e., GPP - ecosystem respiration, including from soil; @missonPartitioningForestCarbon2007]. Large trees also dominate in terms of woody aboveground net primary productivity ($ANPP_{woody}$) and mortality ($M_{woody}$), with trees ???10cm DBH usually contributing > 85% of ANPPwoody and Mwoody across 25 globally distributed forests (Fig. 5b, Piponiot et al., accepted). 

**Include ET figure** Figure 5. Vertical partitioning of (a) evapotranspiration and (b) C fluxes in tropical forests. Panel (a) is from (Kunert et al. 2017). I'd like to create a parallel figure for C fluxes. 

**It is less clear how thermal sensitivity of water and C fluxes varies across strata, but likely responses can be inferred based on the patterns and mechanisms reviewed above.** We expect that transpiration, GPP, and $ANPP_{woody}$ should all be more sensitive to high temperatures-- at least under conditions of moderate to high VPD. A rare example of a study comparing the climate sensitivity of C fluxes across size classes [@meakemRoleTreeSize2018] showed that $M_{woody}$ was more strongly elevated among large than small trees during an El Nino drought in Panama, while the smallest size classes had higher productivity during the drought, likely because of increased light in the understory. It remains far less clear how thermal sensitivity is likely to vary across forest strata under wet conditions, but both physiological mechanisms (Fig. 3) and tree ring evidence (Fig. 4) suggests that understory trees may respond more negatively to hot, wet conditions. Further research is required to better understand the thermal sensitivity of forest ecosystem function across strata.

## Implications [ & future research directions?]

Having established how physical conditions and biological form and function vary across vertical gradients, we now turn attention to the implications of these patterns for our understanding of how forest ecosystems may be impacted by global change, and our ability to project this across space and time.


## Global change responses

The complex interwoven relations between the biophysical environment and biological factors--leaf traits, metabolic processes and distribution of trees-- are likely to produce amplifications and feedback loops in a warming world, with implications for forests on many levels.  

### canopy disturbance

Canopies are crucial to microclimatic functioning, as they buffer several aspects of forest microenvironments [Zelleweger et al. 2019]. This buffering is influenced by the hydraulogical-cycle at large [Davis et al. 2019], therefore severe droughts place canopies at risk, particularly as larger trees suffer more during droughts[Bennett et al. 2015]. Further, increasing global temperatures show that canopies of temperate and tropical forests are already functioning close to thermal threshold and beyond photosynthetic optimas [@mau_temperate_2018; @huangAirTemperatureOptima2019]. This can have implications in the tropics, where thermal limits are narrower than in temperate forests [Perez and Feeley, 2018]. Such increase in canopy $T_{leaf}$ has also shown to reduce forest GPP in the tropics [@pauTropicalForestTemperature2018]. 

Canopy structure affects understory species composition and soil fertility, which has been shown to shift under macroclimatic warming and canopy disturbance [@majasalmiImpactTreeCanopy2020; @bertrandCommentForestMicroclimate2020; @maesPlantFunctionalTrait2020]. Macroclimatic warming will disproportionately affect the less warm-adapted functional types within the forest canopy, even with buffering of climatic extremes, thereby creating holes in the canopy that will take a long time to refill (especially in slow-growing tropical sub-canopy specialists), with associated understory plant thermophilization (death is faster than recruitment and growth) [@duqueThermophilizationAdultJuvenile2015; @zellweger_seasonal_2019; @defrenneMicroclimateModeratesPlant2013]. This imposes an increasing threat to the biodiversity in microrefugias that are  otherwise buffered from extremes [@scheffersMicrohabitatsReduceAnimal2013].

### warming

Warming shifts forest composition, from leaf metabolism to whole forest structure. At a leaf metabolism level, global analysis shows that with temperature increase, foliage photosynthesis and respiration are coupled up to photosynthetic thermal optimum, beyond this inflection point, photosynthesis declines whereas respiration increases exponentially, thereby shifting the C balance from sink to source, independent of water and irradiance [@duffyHowCloseAre2021]. However, taken into account light-induced lower leaf respiration in the day, partionationing of C losses differ diurnally and seasonally across ecosystems [@keenanWidespreadInhibitionDaytime2019]. However, nitrogen that is particularly essential for plant metabolic processes has also shown to decline in forests with warming [Pam Templer et al.]. Temperature driven photosynthesis limitation is also reducing tree growth rates, accompanying a global trend towards more frequently disturbed forests dominated by younger trees [@mcdowellPervasiveShiftsForest2020]. Further, combination of warm-season associated with increased VPD, along with drought exacerbates tree stress[@parkwilliamsTemperaturePotentDriver2013] leading to mortality [@gouldenCaliforniaForestDieoff2019], with implications for forest structure. [**to include Teskey 2015; Breashers et al. 2021**]

Feedback loops from loss of big trees through natural or anthropogenic disturbance (e.g. @senfCanopyMortalityHas2018a, 2020;  @mcdowellMechanismsPlantSurvival2008; @bennettLargerTreesSuffer2015; @stovallTreeHeightExplains2019a] would increase canopy roughness, and reductions in canopy cover is associated with reduced canopy structural complexity [@senfMappingForestDisturbance2020]. Leading to altered biophysical gradient with local heating effects [@zellweger_forest_2020; @starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020], non-linear threshold responses, causing dramatic shifts from one forest state to another (e.g., transition from forest to savanna-like vegetation in tropical forest regions through "savannization"), with energy balance impacts and implications for forest-atmosphere interactions [@starkReframingTropicalSavannization2020]. 

Variation in resistance and resilience among forests may drive different trajectories from the forests in the face of global climate change. For example, African rainforests, with canopy trees that are more resilient to warming and drought than other forests [@bennettResistanceAfricanTropical2021]. Temperature acclimation [@slotGeneralPatternsAcclimation2015; @slotPhotosyntheticPlasticityTropical2021; @wayJustRightTemperature2019; @cunninghamTemperateRainforestTrees2003; @cunninghamTemperateRainforestTrees2003] and recovery from canopy heat stress [@smithEmpiricalEvidenceResilience2020] are other mechanisms that will help forests cope with warming.

*For example, species with smaller leaves and larger $gs$ will be less vulnerable to temperature increase than species with larger leaves [@fauset_differences_2018; @songTreeSurfaceTemperature2020].*

These shifts in forest structure at large may be detectable by lidar and thermal remote sensing. If we know how metabolism maps to the thermal profile, then the observed forest structural changes can inform prediction of forest function.

### Representing Vertical Gradients in Models

Models are needed to predict future ecosystem dynamics, which remain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in Earth System Model (ESM) projections of the future of global carbon cycling and climate change (*Friedlingstein et al. 2006*). 
Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) comprise the land surface models in ESMs used to predict the global distribution of vegetation types and biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks (Cao & Woodward, 1998; Foley et al., 1996; Sitch et al., 2003; Woodward & Lomas, 2004). 
DGVMs operate at a range of scales and have varying degrees of complexity, ranging from detailed individual-based models (*a.k.a.* forest gap models), which represent vegetation at the level of individual plants, capturing spatial variability in the light environment and microclimates at high vertical and horizontal resolution (Christoffersen et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2016; Fyllas et al., 2014; Sato et al. 2007; Shuman et al. 2014; Smith et al., 2001; Bugmann, 2001; Dietze & Latimer, 2011), to big-leaf models that reduce 3D vegetation structure across the entire biosphere into a single vegetation layer (Fig. `r fig_model`). 
This simplification results in greater computational efficiency and thus easier integration into ESMs (Arora & Boer, 2010; Bonan et al. 2003; Cox, 2001; Krinner et al., 2005), although it comes at a cost of a lack of representation of important demographic processes, canopy gap formation, vertical light competition, competitive exclusion, and successional recovery from disturbance (Feeley et al., 2007; Hurtt et al. 1998; Moorcroft et al., 2001; Smith et al. 2001; Stark et al., 2012). 
Improved representation of vegetation demographic processes in ESMs, specifically including forest canopy architectural variation in both horizontal and vertical directions, has repeatedly been identified as a critical step toward reduced uncertainty  and more accurate characterization of biologically mediated feedbacks (Banerjee & Linn 2018, Evans, 2012; Moorcroft, 2006; Moorcroft, Hurtt, & Pacala, 2001; Purves & Pacala, 2008; Thomas, Brookshire, & Gerber, 2015).
Still, as models increase in complexity, model developments and improvements have direct tradeoffs with increased computational cost and potentially decreased interpretability of model output, highlighting the need to identify and parsimoniously represent the most essential drivers of forest ecosystem function.

Enrich this by showing 3-4 carefully selected scenarios (e.g., baseline, warming-mesic, warming-drought, canopy disturbance), and maybe a few key processes/ consequences (leaf T, C balance).** [Issue #42](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/vertical-thermal-review/issues/42). ](schematics/model_schematic.png)

**The findings of this review reinforce the notion that representing vertical structuring is essential to capturing forest dynamics under global change.**
*[how?]*

**The computationally feasible approach to representing vertical structuring in DVGMs lies in Cohort-based models (CBMs), which sit in the middle of this continuum between the oversimplified vegetation dynamics in big-leaf models and the computational expense of individual-based models.** CBMs represent vegetation as cohorts of individual plants, grouped together based on properties including size, age, and functional type (Haverd et al., 2013; Hurtt et al., 1998; Lischke et al. 2006; Medvigy et al. 2009; Moorcroft et al., 2001; Scherstjanoi et al. 2014; Smith et al., 2014; Weng et al., 2015). 
*(KAT: I think all of the following content is great, but probably needs to be heavily tightened:)*

To review the vertical light environment and thermodynamics of CBMs in more detail, we focus here on the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), a model that is actively undergoing continued development and application across a range of ecosystems and landscapes (Moorcroft et al. 2001, Longo et al 2019 Pt 1 & pt 2). ED2 is also the progenitor of the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), the DGVM coupled with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) (Xu & Christoffersen 2017 ) . In ED2, cohorts are tracked across multiple size-classes or individuals within the same plant functional type (PFT). Each cohort can encounter multiple light environments within a single climatic grid cell depending on patch-level disturbance history and vertical light competition that modulates interactions between plant traits and resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the light environment and canopy structure across patches within a grid cell gives rise to varying horizontal and vertical micro-environments that differ in temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil nutrient conditions (Fisher et al 2018). The energy, water, and carbon dioxide cycles are solved separately for each patch in ED2, while fluxes and storage associated with individual plants are solved for each cohort within patches (Longo et al 2019). As a result, vegetation structure and functional distributions are emergent properties in the model that depend on plant functional traits and their interactions with abiotic environmental conditions. Each plant perceives a unique environment, including incident light, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit that varies across local scales in association with the horizontal and vertical position of each cohort relative to other cohorts, in addition to patch level differences in topographic and edaphic conditions. 

Because most CBMs are spatially implicit within grid cells, direct and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is distributed to cohorts of differing heights using radiative transfer models that depend on designated rules associated with how crown architecture is represented, rather than via direct spatial competition determined by spatially explicit crown locations (Fisher et al. 2010?). The flat-top crown method used in ED and ED2 stacks cohort-layers vertically, and a radiative transfer model is used to determine radiation absorbed by each layer at its midpoint, meaning that each cohort is shaded by all taller cohorts. This is distinct from other models that represent crown architecture using a perfect plasticity approximation (PPA) approach, which assumes that tree crowns completely fill canopy gaps through phototropism (stem leaning) and crown filling (Strigul et al. 2008). Discrete canopy layers are comprised of self-organizing crowns that all receive the same incoming radiation. Once the canopy layer is filled with tree crowns, successive shorter trees inhabit the subsequent understory layer and are shaded by the trees in the canopy (Fisher et al 2010/2018?). Models using the PPA approach differ in number of understory layers (e.g. some only have one) (Fisher et al 2018). Though an improvement over big-leaf models, models that separate the canopy into only two layers (e.g., sunlit and shaded portions) may not be able to capture important within-canopy variation in terms of leaf dynamics (e.g., seasonal shifts in vertical leaf area distributions, Smith et al. 2019) and functions (e.g. thermal responses, as we present in this paper). Hence, multi-layered ecosystem models may be necessary for accurately projecting future forest function. (E.g. see de Pury & Farquhar, 1997).


## Conclusions


- across vertical gradients, directional trends in biophysical environment and leaf traits are the rule, suggesting that the physiology and ecology that have these as their underpinnings should also vary
- a number of studies confirm that this is the case.
- However, when we ask the critical question of how the temperature sensitivities  of metabolism and woody growth varies across these different environments, we can't say much-- there are only a small number of studies, often showing insignificant differences or mixed results.
- We lean towards the conclusion that while large canopy trees ware the most vulnerable to warming when combined with drought, understory trees may be more vulnerable under more mesic conditions, but more research is needed. 
- Critically, change to the vertical gradient--e.g., through increased mortality of canopy trees--will change processses across forest strata, with potentially dramatic consequences. (some of the literature on forest degredation or fragmentation could inform what happens when those gradients change)
